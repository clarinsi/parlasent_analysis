122,"We have an excellent report on this by Mario Monti, and our message is very simple: let us act on this report. Because it is incomprehensible, for example, that today it still takes more than 40 hours to travel by train from central and eastern European countries to Brussels, Paris or Amsterdam. How are these people supposed to feel connected to the European Union? How can these markets be fully integrated?",6,1
92,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agenda item is entitled 'Statement by the President of the Commission on the State of the Union'. Today, we have heard about a work programme, and an ambitious and committed one. We have heard little about a stocktake, about the actual state of the Union. What then is the state of the Union today?",5,2
264,"Madam President, the President of the Commission talked about sustainable growth and a target of 75% employment across the EU, a goal we would all agree with. Yet across the EU, drastic cuts in public services are adding to the numbers of unemployed, taking money out of the economy and reducing essential services. How does this help the economy and avoid a job crisis? It really does not make sense.",34,1
66,"What really matters is what the institutions deliver to the people. What matters is the difference Europe makes in their daily lives. The secret of Europe's success is its unique Community model. More than ever, the Commission must drive the political agenda with its vision and proposals.",2,4
279,"Madam President, Europe needs to convert its good intentions into actions, Mr Barroso. The role of the leadership provided by the permanent President of the Union must be acknowledged because he has played a decisive role in the agreement on financial supervision. This is the way forward for the Member States to agree on economic and foreign policy strategies, which are only effective if there is a common position. Otherwise, we will continue to lose positions and international visibility both in peace and security, and in economic and social matters.",40,2
89,"The time has definitely come for Europe to use its own resources. Let us not be afraid of these words. In addition, the question of a European tax must not be taboo. This is not about creating a tax to be added to national taxes; on the contrary, it is about achieving economies of scale and making sure that public funds as a whole are spent in a better way, and thus, ultimately, reducing charges on households and businesses.",4,4
123,"Let us invest in trans-European networks. The fourth important priority, and maybe the most important message for today, concerns the budget and the new financial framework. Let us be very clear about this. The aim of some national governments to reduce the budget by 20% or 30% is ridiculous at a time when what is needed is more European solutions.",6,3
254,"Right, but it is not a one-way street; companies cannot shoulder all the financial sacrifices alone, to the benefit of their non-European competitors. Protect minority rights? It is the right thing to do, but when the members of those minorities do not respect our laws, it is right to send them back to their own countries. We cannot think of becoming a gathering point for the desperate people of the world; we must help them in their own countries.",30,2
178,"Mr President, perhaps I might also be permitted to use both of my speaking times together to speak for three minutes. The European project - if we are debating the state of the Union - seems to many people right across Europe to be in serious jeopardy in four respects. The prosperity and the social security of Europe seem to people to be at risk. The financial crisis and the - perhaps futile - help given to Greece have proven that to people, while the increasing mass unemployment and the mass immigration into our social systems also prove this to them.",11,1
200,"Mr President, I will use my two minutes to try to go back to the questions and answer them. I will not make any personal attacks. You know me: I will not make them and I have never made them. First, regarding the budget and what we have agreed together, the vast majority of Parliament agrees that we need our own budget so that we can reduce the resources used at national level.",13,3
223,"The first is that what our fellow citizens expect from our institutions is to put our projects into concrete form, which will allow them to contemplate the future more calmly. Effective financial supervision and regulation, an affordable and competitive Community patent, and an operational European diplomatic service are among the urgent projects on which our three institutions will be judged. Next, let me stress that only collective, Community-based work by our institutions - the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, the President of the European Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy - will make these types of projects possible, and it will perhaps also allow us to combat the Euroscepticism which continues to gain ground in the Member States. This is why the Belgian Presidency has proposed, Mr President, to strengthen cooperation with the European Parliament on implementing current priorities.",18,2
147,"That is the situation the world finds itself in, Mr Barroso.",7,2
96,"However, you will have three quarters of the members of the Council against you if you talk about own resources. I am now eager to see whether you follow what you have said today with action and take up the fight against the intergovernmentalisation of the European Union. I will give you an example. I agree with you that Europe will only succeed if we defend our elementary values.",5,2
272,"A simple, transparent legal environment with a modest bureaucratic burden would certainly deliver a strong new impulse to Europe, further boosting economic growth. I would like to ask you, Mr Barroso, please, to give some thought to this matter.",37,4
145,"I would say to you, Mr Barroso: put Keynes in Brussels. Public investment today must be European investment in the ecological transformation of our economy. Do you understand this, Mr Barroso? If so, I hope that, in the next discussion about Europe, you will show that you have understood that we are no longer in the 1970s, but today we face a financial crisis and an ecological crisis.",7,2
101,"I expect you to come up with proposals for how we can eliminate this social divide. I therefore say to you that the financial transaction tax must be put in place. We must involve the banks, particularly the speculation sector, in the aftermath of the economic crisis. We have concluded an interinstitutional agreement, Mr Barroso, to the effect that, if this Parliament, with a legislative majority, calls on the Commission to submit a corresponding proposal for a directive, you have agreed that you will do so.",5,2
143,"You spoke, for example, of European investment. You can look at the time; I have three more minutes. I know it is annoying, but that is life. I wanted to say one thing to you: take things seriously.",7,2
139,Is the Commission waiting? Does it have a report in its filing cabinet? Say it publicly: what France is doing contravenes the European treaties. It really is simple to say it and to make it known.,7,2
228,Will this catching-up trend continue in these countries? Will a multi-speed Europe evolve? Will the new Central European and Baltic States have an opportunity to catch up? Will there be enough resources after 2014?,20,2
245,"It fought hard to join the European Union. So why are you undermining and circumventing this vision, which is also your vision? Why are you allowing an attempt to be made to dismantle the basic principles and values on which the Union is based? I refer to the case of Cyprus, where your insistence on the application of Article 207 of the Treaty of Lisbon to the direct trade regulation infringes the Treaty of Accession and, in particular, Protocol 10 on the accession of the whole of Cyprus to the European Union, and deals a severe blow to the sovereignty of Cyprus and, at the same time, solidarity towards the Member States and the credibility of the Union.",26,1
253,"Good, so let us help companies and workers with subsidies for new economic growth and with proper salaries and pensions; let us create a European energy market. Europe is ageing? That is too bad, let us help traditional families made up of men and women to have children with contributions and services. Step up the fight against climate change?",30,4
130,"Mr President, I will do the same as Mr Verhofstadt: I will use all my speaking time at once. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Schulz and Mr Verhofstadt have pointed out the fundamental difficulty of our situation, and I regret that you have not had the clear-headedness or truthfulness to point it out. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, there has been a battle concerning the interpretation of the treaty. I believe that most governments had not read it, and, once it was introduced, they discovered that the Treaty of Lisbon was actually a means and an instrument for the communitisation of European policies.",7,1
114,"It is therefore no surprise to me, nor, I think, to others here in Parliament, that public confidence in Europe has dropped dramatically. You can see this in the latest Eurobarometer, which shows that less than half of our citizens think that their country's membership is a good thing. Trust in our institutions dropped last year to 42%. This is the State of the Union today.",6,1
58,"Copenhagen showed that, while others did not match our ambition, we did not help ourselves by not speaking with one voice. Negotiations may have stalled but climate change has not. I want us to intensify our engagement with international partners to turn their press releases into credible commitments to cut emissions and push forward with fast-start funding. The next two months will see crucial summits with strategic partners.",2,2
100,"On the one hand, we have an increasing number of income millionaires - there are thousands more every year - and, on the other, we have millions of people who are being reduced to poverty. This social divide is the greatest threat to democracy in Europe. In August, the Guardian published statistics which revealed that HSBC, Barclays Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland made more than EUR 20 billion in profit last year, EUR 9 billion of which they are putting aside as bonuses for their managers. This is happening at a time when the governments in the European Union are cutting pensions in Europe.",5,1
282,"The policy that we, as the European Union, follow on issues relating to the movement of persons within the Union and to entry and exit from third countries is unacceptable. We cannot pursue this policy of a besieged and timid Europe. The free movement of persons is fundamental. It has always been so, and it is the foundation on which our present-day societies are built.",41,1
7,"The unemployment problem is an extremely serious one. Budgetary expansion played its role to counter the decline in economic activity. But it is now time to exit. Without structural reforms, we will not create sustainable growth.",2,1
265,"It puts the recovery at risk, a risk that is being taken, by the way, in my own country, the UK, by the Cameron Government. Maintaining investment in areas the EU has a potential to lead in, such as renewable energies and high-speed rail, will help create the Europe we want, it will help create the Europe we need, and it will help secure the economy. Finally, we need to guarantee overseas aid budgets, which are actually seen by some as an easy target. Those countries that fall short, far short, of their target pledges, should be strongly encouraged to rethink this disastrous policy.",34,3
216,"Mr President, I would like to come back to what Mr Barroso so rightly said against racism and xenophobia. However, in this regard, I would like to say that I am still not satisfied with the debate about the Roma, which we will, of course, continue this afternoon. There are side issues being debated that are extremely dangerous. In Germany, for example, we currently have the Sarrazin debate, which is extremely problematic.",16,2
47,"We should invest it where it leverages growth and delivers our European agenda. The quality of spending should be the yardstick for us all. It is important to discuss not only the quantity, but also the quality, of the spending and investment. I believe that Europe offers real added value.",2,4
107,"We will come to help you. Social justice also means that we must not leave the next generation a continent in which it is no longer worth living. You are right, therefore: for social justice, we also need a new, sustainable industrial policy that combines environmental and economic concerns. This is the right approach.",5,4
84,"It is unacceptable that, in the 21st century, we still have draconian rules which no longer have anything to do with the reality of Europe. The second is to take a more serious attitude in our common external policy and, as you have repeatedly said, to become a more respected actor in the world. We can no longer be content with saying that Europe is complicated, that it takes time and that we must be patient. We can also no longer be content with being the primary global donor without being able to guarantee that the aid that we send arrives at its destination along with Mr Putin's and Mr Obama's helicopters.",4,1
183,"Inwardly harsh and regimented towards its citizens, employing centralism and bureaucracy, and outwardly a Europe that is weak, has no place in the world, and is not capable of really securing European interests globally. That is the state of the Union, a Union that is no longer really prepared to secure the interests of the European peoples and the interests of European citizens.",11,1
211,"That is absolutely not the case. You should be carrying out institutional frontal attacks - that is what it comes down to, Mr Barroso. Our criticism of you does not relate to your very definite ability to find consensus. You are certainly capable of that.",14,2
57,"In our globalised world, the relationships we build with strategic partners determine our prosperity. To be effective on the international stage, we need the weight of the European Union. Size matters, now more than ever. A good example is the fight against climate change.",2,4
67,"I have called for a special relationship between the Commission and Parliament, the two Community institutions par excellence. I am intensifying my political cooperation with you. Europe is not only Brussels or Strasbourg. It is also our regions.",2,4
220,"Every single one of the policies fails and leads to a problem - whether it is this or whether it is the euro - and all the way through, we see a fanatical political ambition to create a United States of Europe, regardless of the consequences. At no time has any of this been endorsed by the voting public. That, Mr Barroso, is the true state of the Union.",17,1
46,"Honourable Members, another challenge for next year is sorting out the future budget of the European Union. Next month, we will put forward the Commission's first ideas for the budget review. It will launch an open debate without taboos to prepare our legislative proposals that will be presented in the second quarter of next year. We need to spend our money where we get most value for it.",2,3
14,"We need to tackle severe macro-economic imbalances, especially in the euro area. That is why we made proposals early on to detect asset bubbles, lack of competitiveness and other sources of imbalances. I now see a willingness on the part of governments to accept stronger monitoring, backed up by incentives for compliance and earlier sanctions. The Commission will strengthen its role as an independent referee and enforcer of the new rules.",2,3
237,"Mr President, the state of the Union for us today, in France, is that the citizens, the people, and also the streets are rumbling with discontent. Our fellow European citizens are experiencing an unprecedented crisis of confidence, and they have decided to march to the beat of refusal and demands, but also of hope. What is behind this is a failed proposal for reforming pensions, but not only this. What is at stake is getting older in a dignified manner.",24,1
196,"That is why I believe that we have an immense amount of work to do. If the criticism that some people have directed at me is that I am seeking consensus between the main European political forces, then that is a criticism that I am happy to accept. In fact, the Commission must represent the general European interest, and we must try to represent this same general interest by trying to obtain the contribution of different pro-European political forces. That is what we are doing.",12,2
36,"Even with the Internet, over a third of consumers lack the confidence to make cross-border purchases. At my request, Mario Monti presented an excellent report and has identified 150 missing links and bottlenecks in the internal market. Next month, we will set out how to deepen the Single Market in a comprehensive and ambitious Single Market Act. Energy is a key driver for growth and a central priority for action.",2,3
215,"This is obvious. However, we need to avoid a situation in which any ethnic group is, in any way, attributed with a particular predisposition to crime, because that is, in my opinion, very dangerous and verges on racial discrimination. These are matters which need to be treated tactfully, and they must not be politicised by either side in the dispute. What is needed is a constructive approach, and the problem needs to be resolved.",15,2
146,"To conclude, I will give you a figure which we must all reflect on. The losses due to the crisis are reaching EUR 50 000 billion. This is equivalent to five centuries of public investment in development aid. That would build 10 billion schools in the African countries.",7,1
68,"It is the cities, towns and villages you come from. When you walk round your constituencies, you can point to the European projects that are so important for their prosperity. At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat - the European institutions, Member States and regions. The Union will not achieve its objectives in Europe without the Member States and the Member States will not achieve their objectives in the world without the European Union.",2,3
70,"One thing is certain - it is not through pessimism and constantly promoting defeat that we will win this battle; it is with confidence and with a strong common will. Today, I have outlined how I see the European Union doing that. I have committed myself to delivering the proposals to build our economic union. I have made the case to fast-track our reform agenda.",2,4
155,"They are elected by the citizens of the European Union, and we are defending the rights of those governments to represent their citizens in the Union arena. We want a balance between Union affairs and national affairs in Europe, and this is why we are going to defend the idea of the nation-state, in the context, of course, of the European Union. However, in saying this, I would like to say that I agree with everything that has been said in this Chamber. I say this, now, from the bottom of my heart.",8,5
224,We have planned regular meetings at an administrative as well as a political level in order to intensify our collaboration. It is in this spirit that the Presidency intends to pursue its work over the next four months.,18,4
42,"This trend is set to intensify. Our European Digital Agenda will deliver a single digital market worth 4% of EU GDP by 2020. Mr President, everything we do is for the citizens of Europe. A fundamental dimension of our European project is building an area of freedom, security and justice.",2,4
78,"They understand that we also need more Europe to reduce inequalities and to strengthen our European social model, our social market economy. We therefore need more Europe, not to interfere in the details of everyday life, but to address our common challenges together in a much more efficient way, and - a question I will come back to - in a more profitable and less costly way. As I was saying, our fellow citizens are wondering why Europe is not more efficient and more organised, and why it is not listened to more on the world stage. They quite rightly expect that the economic and financial efforts which they have been asked to make will bear fruit, and that we will bring everyone out of the difficulties together.",4,4
293,"It will clearly be a very complex debate, in an extremely difficult economic situation. If the Member States cannot increase their contribution, resources will have to be found so that the European Union can deliver results. What we cannot do is ask Europe to deliver results without giving it the resources to do so. It would be impossible to do that, and so we must have an extremely serious debate on this issue of solidarity and subsidiarity.",42,1
209,"In this respect, Bernard Kouchner is right in what he said. My second point is that states governed by the rule of law have an obligation to prosecute criminal acts. If something is stolen or if prostitution or fraud is going on, a state governed by the rule of law must enforce the law, no matter who is suspected of having committed the deed. That is the right of every state.",14,2
82,"Europe has also played a pioneering role in the fight against global warming. It really needs to be said: the Copenhagen conference left a bitter taste in the mouth. Our ambitions are unchanged, and the cap is now fixed for good. We can be proud of that.",4,4
124,"I can fully understand that, when confronted with a huge fiscal deficit, they want to cut their direct contributions to the Union. That is a normal, spontaneous reaction. Hence, our proposal to replace these national contributions with European own resources. That takes me to the fifth priority: our credibility in the world.",6,3
13,Debt and deficit lead to boom and bust and they unravel the social safety net. Money that is spent on servicing debt is money that cannot be spent on the social good nor to prepare ourselves for the costs of an ageing population. A debt generation makes an unsustainable nation. Our proposals will strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact through increased surveillance and enforcement.,2,2
201,"This is the first summary that I am making, but let us not forget that we are dealing with a unanimous decision. This is not about criticising our Heads of State or Government, or Mrs Lagarde or Mr SchâˆšÂ§uble; this is about convincing our respective parties, as Mr Barroso said; this is about properly discussing and properly working with this subject at our respective levels, in our respective parties and in our respective countries, as these are unanimous decisions. This will be much more complicated than making grand speeches here, but we will fight, and I will fight to have our own resources at European level. Second, regarding the Roma, let us call a spade a spade.",13,4
162,"Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have provided an impressive insight into the tasks of the various policy areas. Nevertheless, you, and all of us here, have to admit that the trust of European citizens is fading. Mr Verhofstadt has drawn our attention to this and so I will not address the matter in any more detail. These are reliable studies.",9,3
300,"A confidence issue not just at European level, but among political institutions in general. This means that all political decision makers are faced with a major challenge and a major responsibility. I believe that it is precisely by demonstrating strength of conviction that it is possible to have both serious responses and strong responses; not to take the weak middle ground, not to reach false consensus, but to have the courage to uphold, for Europe, this policy of balance, this policy of respect for the differences that exist in Europe. There are differences in Europe.",42,4
117,"It is a second term that needs a new vision and also new answers. It is, in any case, time to change into a higher gear, and to realise important reforms now. From the point of view of our group, there are principally seven big, important reforms. The first thing to do is to finalise our response to the financial crisis.",6,3
303,"We work hard every day in the interests of Europe. I believe that, with you, the representatives directly elected by our fellow citizens, we can do more for a Europe that represents this spirit, a Europe of solidarity, a Europe of conviction, a Europe that is, at the same time, the Europe of the single market and the Europe of cohesion.",42,5
62,Human rights are not negotiable. I am shocked at how the rights of women are being infringed in many countries. I am appalled when I hear that Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani has been sentenced to death by stoning. This is barbaric beyond words.,2,1
35,"What they both need is an open and modern single market. The internal market is Europe's greatest asset, and we are not using it enough. We urgently need to deepen it. Only 8% of Europe's 20 million SMEs engage in cross-border trade, still fewer in investment.",2,2
95,"For during your period of office, you have been making concessions for far too long, particularly after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, concessions to a developing directorial government in Europe, in the Council, under German-French leadership. It is your job to defend the Community method. Much of what you have said here in your address is right, and you can be assured of the support of three quarters of this House. This is the case.",5,3
238,"What is at stake is ensuring an intergenerational solidarity which allows the youngest people today also to live their working life, their professional life, with a pension from which they can benefit. On this very subject, Mr Barroso, the Commission published a Green Paper on the reform of pension systems which unleashed a wave of anxiety from the trade unions before the summer. The proposal that you have made to increase the retirement age seems unrealistic to me. It would be more useful if the Commission told us how we can make sure that workers are able to keep their jobs up to the legal retirement age.",24,2
56,"If we do not act together, Europe will not be a force in the world and they will move on without us - without the European Union but also without its Member States. This is why, in my political guidelines, I called for Europe to be a global player and a global leader - a key task and test for our generation. Together with High Representative and Vice-President Ashton, I will present our vision of how we can maximise Europe's role in the world. With the European External Action Service, we have the means to match our aspirations.",2,4
19,"I want to thank Parliament for the constructive role it has played and I hope it will give its final agreement this month. We will also go further on regulation. Initiatives on derivatives, further measures on credit rating agencies and a framework for bank resolution and crisis management will soon be before you. Our goal is to have a reformed financial sector in place by the end of 2011.",2,5
287,"That is one good example. As you will no doubt recall, when the Commission presented the idea, a few months ago, of having a European Semester, or a period at the start of the year when we work together to prepare our budgets, to see how we can actually coordinate economic policies, straight away, there was a great deal of reaction by certain well-known individuals, who were saying that this undermined national sovereignty and that it even undermined the national parliaments. This was completely untrue. The truth is that, ultimately, thanks to the work that was also done by the task force chaired by Mr Van Rompuy, thanks to the proposals strongly supported by the Commission and the Council, and with the ongoing support of this House, we have succeeded.",42,4
125,"We have the External Action Service, but what we need now, and what we have asked Lady Ashton, the Vice-President of the Commission (it would be better if she were here), is also to develop a new strategy for the Union. Our external policy strategy is still based on a paper by Javier Solana dating from 2003. The world has changed since 2003, and our strategic framework should also be adapted and modernised. That brings me to climate change.",6,2
60,We will continue to show leadership in this forum and work closely with the French G8/G20 Presidency next year. We also want to see support for the Doha Round. Trade boosts growth and prosperity. We will also pursue bilateral and regional Free Trade Agreements.,2,4
136,"We have all gone completely mad, as I have said three or four times, but will we act? Do you know how much money Greece has spent on arms these past ten years? What is the figure? EUR 50 billion in ten years!",7,1
239,"I would like to hear your proposals, and I would also like to hear some details on what you called the fiscal consolidation rather than the economic coordination of our Member States, which I think must be oriented towards social solidarity.",24,2
198,"Therefore, I ask for your help and support so that we can explain, in our countries, to the political forces which form the governments in our capitals, why - as Mr Daul rightly said, by the way - very often the euros that we spend at European level in fact constitute a saving compared with the many euros that we might spend at national level. This battle with public opinion is one that we must win, by having a democratic debate in our countries. This is why I ask for your support so that this debate can take place with the political forces that you represent, not just in Strasbourg or Brussels, but also in the capitals, because we must reach a consensus between Parliament and the Council. The various institutions must reach an agreement.",12,3
99,"You described the dramatic growth in unemployment in Europe. This growth in unemployment will lead to a process of mass impoverishment and to a risk scenario for people. More and more people - including those still in work - are afraid: afraid for their jobs, afraid for their social stability and afraid for their future. This needs to be illustrated with figures.",5,1
185,"Some people have said that they would have preferred a speech analysing the situation. Rather than commenting on the past and the present, I prefer to construct the future. I believe that the most important thing is not to comment - I leave that to the commentators, for whom I have a lot of respect, by the way - but I believe that our role, the role of the Commission, is to make proposals. For me, the speech on the state of the Union also concerns the state to which we want to lead the Union with our joint efforts.",12,4
133,"This Commission, in its general statements, is the champion of Europe. They are very beautiful statements. However, when it comes to pointing the finger, describing a situation affecting a Member State, naming someone or a government by name, you are conspicuously silent. You do not exist.",7,1
120,"That is a nonsensical situation - even worse, it is a dangerous situation. We cannot afford to be one Union and, at the same time, to have 27 different economic strategies, as we do today. It is crystal clear that if we want the Stability and Growth Pact and the new economic strategy to be a success, we need a serious carrot and stick approach, with proper sanctions. In my opinion - and I think in the opinion of the majority of this House - it is good that the Council is thinking about this in connection with a task force, but that cannot replace the right of initiative of the Commission, and the duty of the Commission to come forward as fast as possible with a global legislative proposal on economic governance.",6,2
189,"We are currently experiencing an extremely difficult time from an economical and social point of view, and this is a time when everyone must show responsibility. We know well that, at difficult economic times, the tendency is for public opinion to have little confidence in political institutions, either at national or European level. I believe that the best way of responding to these worries is with results and with proposals. In essence, I believe that we are in agreement - at least, the pro-European majority in the European Parliament is.",12,3
138,"This is my example, Mr Barroso, of the non-intervention of your Commission. I can give you a second example, which was provided by Mr Verhofstadt. Today, what is happening with the Roma is a test of the credibility of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which forms part of the Treaty of Lisbon. To put it in a moral and philosophical way, I quote Albert Camus: 'Democracy is about defending minorities, not simply executing the will of majorities'.",7,2
128,"I would even say that they are using dubious methods to confuse issues when it comes to migration. I would like to say most emphatically that I find this attitude to be incompatible with the principles and values that make our Union one of the most beautiful and one of the greatest political ideas to which the human spirit and heart have given birth. Mr President, I intend to say it emphatically: the Roma are European citizens, fully-fledged citizens. We can never accept their rights being violated - never - in a world racked with all manner of uncertainties.",6,2
302,"They are justifiable. Looking beyond these ideological differences, however, can we or can we not have a strong consensus in favour of Europe? I believe that we can. The Commission reaches consensus every day; my colleagues, from 27 countries, have different cultural and national backgrounds, and different ideologies.",42,5
234,"Mr President, as the President of the Commission acknowledges, belief that the EU is a good thing has fallen substantially, and many people believe their Member States have not benefited from membership. We should be worried, but I fear that the Commission is under pressure from those who believe that the solution to every crisis is more Europe. Indeed, some argue that polls demonstrate support for more European economic governance. However, the public does not want more Europe; it wants a better Europe and a Europe that adds value with a light touch.",22,2
141,"There was nothing on that. You did not talk about Cancâˆšâˆ«n. We have three months until Cancâˆšâˆ«n. There was not a word on the fact that if we want to be credible on climate change, we must return to a 30% target for reduction in CO2, and we must be at the forefront of the debate on climate change.",7,1
9,"Europe must show that it is more than 27 different national solutions. We either swim together or sink separately. We will only succeed if, whether acting nationally, regionally or locally, we think European. Today, I will set out what I see as the priorities for our work together over the coming year.",2,4
129,"I believe that this Europe must remain a continent of freedom, tolerance and justice. Mr President, the Commission, the guardian of the treaties, must react uncompromisingly. This is not just its right; it is an institutional duty.",6,3
23,"Over 6.3 million people have lost their jobs since 2008. Each one of them should have the chance to get back into employment. Europe's employment rates are at 69% on average for those aged between 20 and 64. We have agreed that these should rise to 75% by 2020, bringing, in particular, more women and older workers into the workforce.",2,2
31,"We need to improve Europe's innovation performance not only in universities but along the whole chain, from research to retail, notably through innovation partnerships. We need an Innovation Union. Next month, the Commission will set out how to achieve this. Another key test will be whether Member States are ready to make a breakthrough on a patent valid across the whole European Union.",2,3
88,"At the moment, we are forcing our researchers to leave Europe. We must absolutely make sure that our researchers want to come back and stay in Europe. Mr Barroso, these are the real issues that we, Parliament and the Commission, must put on the table when we talk about negotiations on the financing of European projects for 2014-2020. These are the questions that our fellow citizens are asking themselves, and to which they are expecting serious answers.",4,2
131,"In all the discussions, the battle which is taking place - we have seen it on foreign services, we have seen it on the situation of financial regulation - always gets to the same point. The question at issue is - and it has already been said - are we moving towards an intergovernmental Europe or a strengthening of the Community-based Europe? This is precisely the situation of the Union today. What I dream of is that the Commission will make a public declaration.",7,2
115,"That is alarming but, at the same time, we have to recognise that it is not surprising. Parliament urged European leaders many times to end the standstill on Europe, to move forward, to quit protectionism and nationalism and to work on European solutions. That is also what the European citizens are asking for because, if you look at the same Eurobarometer, you see that no less than 86% of the public want European economic governance. They believe that only the Union can provide solutions to the financial and economic crisis.",6,2
40,"This means integrating the different strands of policy on climate change, energy, transport and environment into a coherent approach on resource efficiency and a low carbon future. A forward-looking agricultural sector will play a major role in European measures to address some of the biggest challenges ahead, such as global food security, biodiversity loss and the sustainable management of natural resources. So will our maritime policy. All of this will not only strengthen our economy tomorrow, but will provide new openings today.",2,4
227,"Mr President, since the international financial crisis and economic downturn, new divisions have emerged in the European Union. There are no longer any grounds for making distinctions between old and new Member States. President Barroso has not mentioned the reason why the gulf is beginning to deepen between the eastern and southern parts of the EU. Before accession, we in the new Member States saw Ireland, Spain and Portugal's success in catching up with the rest of Europe as an inspiring example.",20,3
174,"And, in your own country, well, why should the German taxpayer increasingly pick up the bill? This form of government is not working, and yet what we heard today is that we are going to have a common defence policy and a common foreign policy. The other reason why these polls are where they are is that people do not respect you because you cheated to get the Lisbon Treaty through. We were told it would simplify everything, that we would know where we stand.",10,1
212,"You have seen today that everyone is satisfied with you. In your personal conversations, Mr Barroso, you are definitely capable of attack - something that your commissioners and I myself know very well. However, I would ask you for once to show the ability to go publicly on the offensive, specifically in relation to the Heads of State or Government, because that is what we need in Europe, an element that is willing to confront those who want to renationalise Europe. To you, Mr Farage, I would say this: it may well be that I do not know how it works, that people are freely stuffing their pockets, but I know very well how to put an end to these people's games.",14,3
219,"Mr President, the row over the Roma in France is, of course, caused directly by failing European Union policies. It was a huge mistake to allow Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union whilst there were millions of Roma in those countries being heavily discriminated against. It is no wonder that, now they are part of the Union, they are seeking to move elsewhere. That goes for everything does it not?",17,1
203,"Nevertheless, serious crime is to be deplored. I did not say that it was the Roma. Do not put words in my mouth. What we must fight against are banditry, crime and prostitution.",13,1
75,"What have we done successfully together these past few years, and in what ways have we failed? What plans do we have? What political means and, in particular, what financial means will we make available for implementing them? Mr President, this debate is welcome, and I am happy that Parliament and the Commission, the two Community institutions which represent and defend the general European interest, are this morning participating in this exercise, which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) would like to be a forward-looking one.",4,5
154,"This is a fact which must not be ignored. How, therefore, can Europe speak with one voice on the global stage if different European governments speak with different voices? Ladies and gentlemen, let us not deceive ourselves - that is how it will be. You can, while sitting in this Chamber, close your eyes and pretend that those 27 governments do not exist, but they do.",8,2
33,"We will also act further on red tape. SMEs are being strangled in regulatory knots. 71% of CEOs say that the biggest barrier to their success is bureaucracy. The Commission has put proposals on the table to generate annual savings of EUR 38 billion for European companies. Stimulating innovation, cutting red tape and developing a highly-skilled workforce: these are ways to ensure that European manufacturing continues to be world class.",2,4
6,"Clearly, uncertainties and risks remain, not least outside the European Union. We should be under no illusions. Our work is far from finished. There is no room for complacency.",2,1
113,"Mr President, the State of the Union means, first of all, looking back and learning the lessons of the past, and then looking to the future. Let us be honest with ourselves and say that last year was a very difficult year for the Union. It was a difficult year for the Union because there were big problems, but little unity to solve those problems. Greece was on the brink of collapse, the euro itself was under attack for months, and it took several months for the European governments to finally agree to save a Member State and to save our common currency.",6,1
226,"That is why we have to solve the problem of high-level public debt now and take painful measures to this end, and that is why we cannot accept a 20% unemployment rate among young people. This percentage has now been laid down in the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, but this will mean that disadvantaged children and children from minorities continue to be marginalised. Therefore, the Council faces the challenge of increasing youth employment, in order to meet Parliament's ambition of 90% of young people in either work or education and just 10% youth unemployment. Achieving this by 2020 is a very important objective for our European Union.",19,2
205,"We must work on this subject to propose solutions regarding the Roma that we have in this Parliament, and also with Romania and other countries concerned. I believe that this subject is too important. If we succeed in allowing the children of these immigrants to benefit from education and training, we will win the battle within ten years. This is what I propose for the discussion.",13,4
77,"How, for example, can we justify our absence from the negotiations between Israel and Palestine, when we are the primary donors in this region? Europeans do not understand this, and they are right. Our fellow citizens are also aware that we need more Europe, not less, to safeguard our security, whether it is personal security, energy security or food security. They know that Europe must be better coordinated to create growth and jobs, as you described so well, to regulate the markets and to avoid renewed speculative attacks.",4,2
229,"Mr President, the new Member States would like a European Union marked by strength, solidarity and dynamism.",20,2
53,"Let us call it a 'five plus five' option. This will give us longer-term planning and a clearer link with the mandates of both our institutions. Of course, part of a credible European budget is the rigorous pursuit of savings. I am looking at the administrative costs within the Commission and other Community bodies like agencies.",2,4
81,"I believe that, on several important subjects, Europe has no cause to be ashamed of its actions during these past few months. It was Europe which took the initiative to reform the financial markets after the Wall Street crisis of autumn 2009. It was Europe which, after having suffered unprecedented speculative attacks in the previous spring, took measures which were also unprecedented to strengthen and stabilise its economy. The initial effects of this policy have already been felt, but we must go even further.",4,5
93,"The state of the Union is not good. It would have been a good thing if, in your stocktake, you could have gone into why it is not good. It is not good, partly because you, Mr Barroso, and your Commission, are not adequately performing the essential roles ascribed to you in the treaties. During the crisis, I have often asked myself 'Where is the Commission?', and then when I speak to you, you say: 'Yes, I have made a statement on that and I have issued a press statement on this and Mr â‰ˆâ€ efÆ’Ã§oviÆ’Ã§ said something about that and Mrs Reding about this!'",5,1
105,"I therefore think you are right: these uninspired European finance ministers who, because they need to reduce the excessive debt in their own countries and are therefore cutting the budgets, are saying that the EU budget must therefore also be cut, are wrong. The EU does not need to balance out an excessive deficit. With the investments that it makes, it needs to use regional policy, social policy, research and qualifications and investment in growth-stimulating measures to help to even out the social imbalance and to put the European Union in a position to be able to do that. For this, we need a strong EU budget.",5,3
135,"You went to church and prayed, and you believed that if you prayed, everything in Greece would sort itself out. It has not sorted itself out. Afterwards, you supported - and we supported by a majority - applying unbelievable pressure on Greece, and on the Greek people, who made just as many mistakes as the Greek elites. However, at the moment, Mr Barroso, while we are putting this pressure on the Greek people in order to resolve the problem, I have not heard you talk about the fact that now, in August, there have been negotiations between the Greek Government and the large French and German arms companies on continuing arms sales by European businesses to Greece.",7,1
256,"However, the EU, like each of its Member States, is embracing globalism and voluntarily accepting a deluge of cheap goods that are emerging from low-wage countries in the third world. The only way in which we can compete with such countries is to drive down our wage rates to their levels. Just in case our employers and employees are not getting the message, we are filling up our countries with third-world workers who are turning large areas of our countries into parts of the third world with below-minimum wage rates and unsatisfactory working conditions. We are making workers in the commercial services sector redundant and outsourcing their jobs to the third world.",31,1
48,"That is why I will be pushing for an ambitious post-2013 budget for Europe. I believe we should pool our means to back our policy priorities. The issue is not about spending more or less, but spending more intelligently by looking at European and national budgets together. The EU budget is not for Brussels.",2,4
250,"Mr Barroso, there is no point in making speeches about the state of the Union if, at a time when one of the fundamental principles of the Union is under attack, the President of the Commission's response is tepid, timid and weak. Mr Barroso, your first reference to what is happening to the Roma in France was more or less adequate; your second was, frankly, an embarrassment for the Commission. That is because what started with the Roma is already moving on to the poor: President Sarkozy said yesterday that Europeans without means of supporting themselves in France could not stay there more than three months. That means that, not only will this leave us on the brink of destroying the principle of freedom of movement, which is fundamental to the EU, but also that we will now be more vulnerable to the crisis, because, as we know very well, workforce mobility is one way in which countries respond to the crisis.",29,1
267,"We will debate that this afternoon as well. We need a common European policy that enables these population groups - not only in France, but in other states, too - to live in the countries they want to live in. As several speakers have already said, the Roma in Europe are Europeans. In France, I believe, 90% have French citizenship.",35,4
214,"We do not agree on many matters which have the support of the majority in this House, but we do sit in this Parliament so that Europe will be better and not worse, and we are always ready to talk about this. I do appreciate, Mr Barroso, that you are open to having this debate with us. As for the matter of the Roma, which has been raised, here, I do not often agree with Mr Schulz, but I do agree with him on this. I think that if a country has a problem of a criminal nature, it should do everything possible to tackle that problem, because the citizens pay tax so that the state will fight criminals.",15,3
65,"We are also making progress on a common foreign policy, but let us be under no illusions. We will not have the weight we need in the world without a common defence policy. I believe now is the moment to address this challenge. Honourable Members, we are still bedding down the new institutional set-up of Europe created by the Lisbon Treaty.",2,2
286,"I should also like to highlight an aspect mentioned by the Belgian Presidency, which is the importance of obtaining concrete results. We have presented, both in my speech and in the document that I forwarded to you via President Buzek, a very ambitious draft programme that includes, for example, the Community patent, public services - which some of you have spoken about - and many other measures that are the real test not only of the Community method, but of our real ambition for Europe. On the subject of ambition, I should like to mention a positive development. I have just learnt that the Ecofin Council has approved our proposal for a European Semester.",42,5
97,"The elementary values in Europe include no racism and no xenophobia. That is something that we all agree on. However, they also include the fact that a government that is subject to internal political pressure must not attempt to use a witch hunt against minorities as a solution. We can name names here.",5,2
160,"Today, in your speech, I see a chance for a Europe of greater economic freedom and a Europe of closer integration, by which I mean the common market. I am very pleased that the idea of the Single Market Act came from this Parliament, from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. It came from the Monti report, which was written in the Committee whose chair is my colleague, Mr Herber, and we are proud of this. It is this kind of strengthening of the market which we want.",8,5
137,"Mr Barroso, you knew this. One of the problems these countries have is precisely this structure, which is related to a European problem of nationalism and the battle or debate between Greece and Turkey. Where is the Commission's initiative and Europe's initiative to intervene so that, through integrating Turkey, we put an end to this ridiculous debate which is costing the Greek people billions for absolutely nothing, because Greece is buying back arms which France and Germany do not need for their own armies. This is very intelligent!",7,1
207,"Now I am speaking as a former mayor. For 11 years, I was mayor of a town that had a great deal to do with the Roma. My town is on the border that separates Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. We are a transit area for many Roma.",14,99
16,"We took action to increase bank transparency. Today, the situation is better than it was a year ago. With the publication of the stress test results, banks should now be able to lend to each other so that credit can flow to Europe's citizens and companies. We have proposed protecting people's savings up to EUR 100 000.",2,5
255,"Mr President, Mr Barroso has spoken of sustainable growth. In fact, we have seen negative growth. He spoke of increasing the proportion of people in employment, whereas that proportion has fallen. He speaks of increasing the competitiveness of European goods and services.",31,1
277,"Continuing with the status quo is not an option. If we do not move forwards, we will fall backwards. We therefore need to support the project aimed at creating an economic and social union in addition to the monetary union. In this regard, we need initiatives, timetables and specific sanction mechanisms, not just announcements.",39,2
202,"Ladies and gentlemen, Presidents, we are responsible people, and we must find solutions. This is the mayor of the town speaking. We are encountering enormous problems when it comes to our fellow citizens, who are proper democrats, and who we are risking giving over to the populist camp. We have a duty here.",13,1
27,"We must make sure that the most vulnerable are not left behind. This is the focus of our 'Platform Against Poverty'. It will bring together European action for vulnerable groups such as children and old people. As more and more people travel, study or work abroad, we will also strengthen citizens' rights as they move across borders.",2,5
195,"Furthermore, we must always stress the balance between freedom, particularly freedom of movement, and security. If we do not respect this balance, we run the serious risk of this issue being instrumentalised by extremist forces which will be able to exploit, in a populist manner, the feeling of insecurity which exists in many of our societies. Therefore, let us provide a serious and responsible answer, and let us always avoid using an extremely serious and extremely sensitive issue for political purposes. The Commission will take this position of responsibility.",12,2
169,"You said how you felt things were going, you pointed your way forwards. However, Eurobarometer, the Commission's own polling organisation, tells us the truth. It tells us that in the last six months, there has been a dramatic drop in confidence as regards people's belief in even belonging to the Union: a 10% drop in Germany; a 17% drop in Greece and a 9% drop in Portugal. Less than half of EU citizens think that being a member of the club is worth it.",10,1
76,"Europeans sometimes - in fact, often - wonder what Europe is really doing to respond to their problems and their expectations. At the same time, as all the opinion polls have shown for years, they are asking not for less Europe, but for more Europe. More Europe on the issue of migration: the Roma question, which requires a long-term European strategy, is a perfect illustration of the issue of respect for people. More Europe to represent them in the world.",4,2
32,"Our innovators often pay ten times the price faced by their competitors in the United States or in Japan. Our proposal is on the table. It would substantially reduce the cost and double the coverage. After decades of discussion, it is time to decide.",2,3
173,"Well, it is perfectly clear that this currency does not suit Germany and it does not suit Greece. One is now trapped inside an economic prison. You can pretend the crisis has gone away, but it has not, because the bond spreads are now 8% on five and ten-year bonds. You can smile, Mr Schulz, but you know nothing of financial markets or how these things work.",10,1
94,"When I go back and read it, then yes, it is true, the Commission has indeed made a statement. However, I have to ask myself: Why is the message not getting through? Why is the public not hearing it? That is a stocktake of the state of the Union!",5,1
108,"I am eager to see whether you manage to ensure that the disaster, the fiasco of Copenhagen is not repeated - a situation in which we saw that the European Union was not capable of negotiation. That is not the fault of the Commission, I will say that again. It is the fault of the 27 governments, which were simply not able to agree at an international level. This shows that, in the situation that we are in today, there are two opposing schools: one advocating intergovernmentalism and one the Community method.",5,1
213,"Mr Barroso, if you thought I was criticising you because you try to take account of the needs of every group, let me assure you that my statement was not meant as criticism. I value your diplomatic abilities in this area, and I think that maintaining a balance between the various Member States is even more difficult. This, I am sure, requires even greater effort from you than keeping each political group happy. Since you talked about a pro-European majority and an anti-European minority, I would like to ask everyone, in the name of democratic and honest debate, not to lump together those who do not like what is being planned for Europe or who do not want the European Union - because I do not agree with these people - with those who say they want to change something in Europe and who are interested in these plans.",15,4
230,"Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have presented us with a lot of fine words. I hear your words, but I ask myself: where is the action? The Roma, for example. It is not important to me that you criticise Mr Sarkozy in particularly strong terms.",21,1
109,"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is a question of whether the Lisbon Europe is a Europe of the Heads of State or Government who discuss what they believe to be right for the continent behind closed doors. We saw this during the crisis in Greece. The final document was negotiated by just two people, Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy, and their approach was: Mr Van Rompuy, please wait outside, leave this to us! I do not know whether what has been said about this is true, but we can almost imagine that it is.",5,1
218,"In this regard, I have seen things in my country, which is not particularly xenophobic, that I had not thought possible. We must remain sensitive to nationalistic, xenophobic and racist statements in the European Union.",16,2
127,"Unfortunately, however, this is not an isolated case. Like many of you, I notice that several governments today, in facing the economic crisis, are succumbing more and more to the temptation, as it were, of populism, xenophobia and sometimes even racism. They are exploiting people's worries and the fear of the other. They are stigmatising minorities.",6,1
166,"It has not reached the people with real social needs or been put into education. No one would want to dispute or belittle the EU's successes. However, papering over the very real inconsistencies in the European Union will not help anyone. I, too, would like to finish by saying something about the Roma in France.",9,1
261,"Some time ago, I found my office cabinet broken into in this very Parliament. I did not think that this was a problem to do with a particular region or people. I thought it was down to someone who needed to be found and punished.",32,1
281,"Madam President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the situation imposed on the Roma - their expulsion and the denial of their right to free movement in Europe - is unacceptable and goes against European values. However, this situation is but the symptom of a more serious and more general problem. It is merely the reflection of a disease in our so-called modern societies, where we are losing sight of what binds us together as human beings. No, human beings are not commodities that can be stocked and destocked.",41,1
44,"The Commission will make new proposals on policing our external borders. We will bring forward an internal security strategy to tackle threats of organised crime and terrorism. Europeans will find that their fundamental rights and obligations exist wherever they go. Everyone in Europe must respect the law and governments must respect human rights, including those of minorities.",2,4
2,"They will define a Europe of opportunity where those that aspire are elevated and those in need are not neglected. A Europe that is open to the world and open to its people. A Europe that delivers economic, social and territorial cohesion. Over the last year, the economic and financial crisis has caused our Union to face one of its greatest challenges ever.",2,3
289,"One of the Members of this House said: 'You have presented some interesting proposals, but how can you be sure they will succeed?' That is a good question. We must work together. We will make progress with this ambition.",42,4
12,They have been well received by this Parliament and in the Task Force chaired by the President of the European Council. They are the basis around which a consensus is being developed. We will present the most urgent legislative proposals on 29 September so as not to lose momentum. Unsustainable budgets make us vulnerable.,2,4
132,"In the European institutions at the moment, there is a political battle, and this political battle is about the interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon, and that has consequences for European policies. The European citizens must know what we know and what we feel in the interinstitutional debates. On that, Mr Barroso, you have said nothing. With that, I come to my second point.",7,2
55,"If we act decisively, we have nothing to fear from the 21st century. As the strategic partnerships of the 21st century emerge, Europe should seize the chance to define its future. I am impatient to see the Union play a role in global affairs that matches its economic weight. Our partners are watching and are expecting us to engage as Europe, not just as 27 individual countries.",2,4
91,"In order to make Europe progress, for our fellow citizens, for the PPE Group, we will be with you if you make good proposals. As I have a few seconds left, I would like to say another thing to you: be provocative in the first instance; go far with your suggestions, and we will manage to come up with good proposals together for our fellow European citizens.",4,5
5,"The economic outlook in the European Union today is better than it was a year ago, not least as a result of our determined action. The recovery is gathering pace, albeit unevenly within the Union. Growth this year will be higher than initially forecast. The unemployment rate, whilst still much too high, has stopped increasing.",2,5
199,"The Commission will be there. The Commission will bring forward ambitious proposals, but always in a true spirit of partnership for a stronger Europe, a Europe of cooperation and not a Europe of division.",12,5
119,"We are not even half way. We still need the Commission to come forward urgently with proposals on derivatives, on short-selling, on credit rating agencies, on banking resolution, on market abuse, on trading and on financial instruments. The second big task is that we need genuine European economic governance. Last year showed that a common currency without a common economic policy simply does not make sense.",6,2
61,"In October, the Commission will present a renewed trade policy to drive new benefits for Europe. Being open to the world also means standing side by side with developing countries, especially with Africa. When I go to the Millennium Development Goals High-Level Event in New York in two weeks' time, I intend to commit - with your support and on behalf of the European Union - an extra EUR 1 billion to the Millennium Development Goals. Being a global player also means standing up for our values.",2,5
259,"I hope that the new legislation will make the banking system share not only in the profits, but also in development and in assuming economic risk. The future budget must take into account the current situation, but not with budget reduction in mind. Viable means need to be found to ensure that money is spent efficiently at national and European level. The value and distribution of the budget must be based on the requirements of the common agricultural, cohesion, energy and climate change policies.",32,3
180,"Data storage, for example, as manifested through the SWIFT agreement with the United States, gives people the feeling of being permanently spied on. Regulation in the context of a paternalistic system is spreading increasingly in the Union, giving citizens the impression that their personal freedom is being curtailed. The freedom of thought and speech is also increasingly being jeopardised through political correctness. In this context, I refer to the debate about Mr Sarrazin in Germany.",11,1
274,"There is a belief that the European Union can do better than individual Member States, and that is certainly a strong belief in the Member State I represent, Ireland, where we are in the depths of an economic and banking crisis which requires deep analysis and scrutiny. Unemployment is the biggest problem we face here, and if we now have strict enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact, I worry about the impact it might have on employment, with increasing numbers of young people disillusioned and in a state of crisis because of the situation. I welcome your comments on food security, biodiversity and sustainable growth, but be careful that Doha and bilateral trade agreements do not destroy those noble objectives.",38,2
232,"My second point is that there has been talk here of a loss of confidence by European citizens. Citizens had very little mention in your address. However, we also need the European institutions to show modesty towards citizens. Thus, the principle that 'every European euro is better spent in Europe' is wrong.",21,2
17,"We will propose to ban abusive naked short selling. We will tackle credit default swaps. The days of betting on someone else's house burning down are over. We continue to insist that banks, not taxpayers, must pay up front to cover the costs of their own risks of failure.",2,2
106,"You said the same thing today. In this, you have our support. So now show your opposition to Mrs Lagarde, Mr SchâˆšÂ§uble and the finance ministers of other countries! If you need help in this, Mr Barroso, please give us a call.",5,2
217,"In this regard, the fact is being overlooked that in Germany, there are poorly educated sections of the population - of Germans, immigrants and also of Roma and nationals of other countries - who are all relatively poorly catered for in schools and we have insufficient means and a lack of smart methods to be able to really help these children. This breeds racism. Finally, I would like to say that sometimes, racism can arise unintentionally. I would not like to forget the debate about Greece.",16,1
159,"The citizens of Europe understand perfectly well that one can be a good Pole, a good European or a good German, and that we can live together, treating each other with respect and working together to build a common future. Mr President, I hope you succeed. However, the way to repairing the situation is not to repeat the old mistakes. I want to tell you very clearly that, in my opinion, Europe must not try to solve the problems which we have before us by repeating the mistakes of the past.",8,3
111,"In a year's time at the next report on the state of the Union, we will measure you by what you have announced today and by what, by then, you have managed to fight for. The speech that you gave was a conservative-liberal, green, radical socialist one. Something for everyone. Thus, you can also gain support from everyone.",5,3
260,"You mentioned that there is a shortage of millions of jobs in Europe. The current budget has some unspent resources. These resources need to be reallocated to areas which create jobs. On the other hand, Member States must have the option to transfer funds from areas where there is insufficient demand to areas where applications have exceeded the resources allocated.",32,2
8,We must use the next 12 months to accelerate our reform agenda. Now is the time to modernise our social market economy so that it can compete globally and respond to the challenge of demography. Now is the time to make the right investments for our future. This is Europe's moment of truth.,2,4
193,"We have important support programmes for providing help to the Roma and assisting their integration. We are in constructive and serious dialogue with all the governments in Europe, both with the governments of countries from which Roma originate and governments of countries in which Roma currently have a significant presence. I believe I can ask you quite sincerely not to play politics with this question. This is an extremely sensitive issue and an extremely serious one.",12,3
263,"I hope therefore that we will meet here soon and discuss concrete measures, and that together, we will also overcome the Council.",33,3
86,"I would like the European External Action Service to be an effective instrument from this point of view, and we can make sure that savings are made in our various Member States if we put this instrument in place. The third way of making sure that the European structure is up to the challenges has to do with the key factor in all this: money. I know that we still need to discuss this in depth. Are we all going to continue to invest separately in innovation and research?",4,4
148,"I will begin with some good news for Mr Barroso, the kind of news on which he may even be congratulated. His appearance today has been valued higher than tickets to the next Sting concert in Prague, which cost less than EUR 150. However, I will begin with a story. Mr Barroso, in Poland there is a popular story which tells how a man climbs a tree and begins sawing off the branch on which he is sitting.",8,2
208,"I worked with this problem for 11 years and so there is one thing I would like to say to you, Mr Daul, and to my fellow Members. Yes, the Roma are a difficult minority. That is true, but even difficult minorities have a right to protection of their fundamental rights. That is the essential message.",14,2
165,"This is something that we all need to involve ourselves with over the next few months. The situation in the Union varies greatly for the different sections of the population and it is full of inconsistencies. The social division in the societies of the EU countries has, in any case, widened dangerously once again. In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, a large amount of money, billions of euro, have gone to rescue or to stand as security for the banks.",9,1
246,"Mr President, I should like to say this to Mr Barroso: you are wrong. You cannot have sound proposals without analysis and retrospection. You are also wrong in that you cannot have both the fiscal consolidation that we are currently implementing and growth with jobs. We are failing to learn the lessons of history.",27,1
296,"If anyone says otherwise, they are not telling the truth. More and better, that is the truth. Similarly, it must be said very clearly that, without budgetary consolidation, we will not have confidence. If there is no confidence, there is no growth.",42,2
164,"Today, the unions are striking in France and on 29 September, strike action will be taken in many towns and cities in Europe against the Member States' austerity policies. Citizens were promised that the Treaty of Lisbon would make the European Union more social and more democratic. The EU, including the Commission and the Parliament, would simply lose credibility if it now said that the Member States are responsible for the austerity measures. Effective financial market reforms, for example, like a ban on hedge funds, or a ban on speculation on raw materials and food derivatives, or even a financial transaction tax, but also the move away from the flexicurity ideology, are now most definitely the responsibility of the European Union.",9,2
270,"We are setting up teams to improve the performance of a dead horse, to improve the diet of a dead horse and to improve the image of a dead horse. I would urge you to consider, Mr President, whether it is not time to dismount from the dead horse.",36,1
85,"On this as well, I believe that we must take a serious attitude. Europe is one of the major global powers, and its main priority, in my opinion, must be to build relations as equals with its main partners, and, in particular, with the United States. I said this earlier here when talking about transatlantic relations. However, this morning I also want to highlight the importance for Europe of building strategic and targeted relations, not only with Russia, but also with China, India and Brazil.",4,4
25,"This is the Europe we will build if Member States, the European institutions and the social partners move ahead on our common reform agenda. It should be centred on skills and jobs and investment in lifelong learning. It should focus on unlocking the growth potential of the single market, to build a stronger single market for jobs. The opportunities exist.",2,3
20,"Sound government finances and responsible financial markets give us the confidence and economic strength for sustainable growth. We need to move beyond the debate between fiscal consolidation and growth. We can have both. Honourable Members, sound public finances are a means to an end: growth for jobs.",2,4
284,"President Barroso, what action - bold, concrete action - are you going to take to enable us to adhere to our values once again on this issue?",41,2
74,"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Presidents of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the chairs and the presidents are happy this morning, and you have demonstrated that you can be present without penalty. Well, that is indeed democracy. Thank you to all of you. What is the state of the European Union?",4,4
206,"Mr President, I would like to make a brief comment with regard to the two points mentioned by Mr Daul. Firstly, we are agreed that we need our own resources. We are fighting together for these resources of our own, but because unanimity is required and because we probably will not get a unanimous decision, there will therefore be no own resources, so consequently, it needs to be clarified that, if this is the case, there will also be no reduction in the EU budget. Hopefully, that is the conclusion that we will also then come to together.",14,3
268,"Current policy in France is contrary to all European fundamental rights, and therefore I expect some clear speaking from you.",35,1
236,"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that many governments spend the night taking apart what the Commission creates by day. It is therefore important for the Commission to add its own timely contribution to a correct interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity, so that it does not become an excuse for thwarting and limiting the progress made by the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to say this to my liberal and socialist colleagues: if you are so concerned to accuse democratic governments of racist policies and you really believe what you are saying and consider that the Commission is complicit in or has a weakness for these policies, why do you not call for Commissioners from liberal and socialist backgrounds to resign from their positions? Lastly, a suggestion to President Buzek: we ought to apply to the absent MEPs the same sanctions that the European Commission will certainly apply with regard to the absence of Vice-President Ashton.",23,2
37,"We need to complete the internal market for energy, build and interconnect energy grids, and ensure energy security and solidarity. We need to do for energy what we have done for mobile phones: give real choice for consumers in one European marketplace. This will give us a real energy community in Europe. We need to make frontiers irrelevant for pipelines or power cables, to have the infrastructure for solar and wind energy, and to ensure that across the whole of Europe, we have a common standard so that charging electric car batteries becomes as natural as filling up the tank.",2,4
161,We want a common market and greater freedom in the economy.,8,2
242,"Now that the next G20 is to take place, I heard that France is to chair it. What is the point of that? A representative of the EU, the EU itself, should be there. I think that this point should be raised, and if the EU wants to find a new voice, then a representative of the EU must deliver this speech.",25,2
98,"It is the government of Nicolas Sarkozy, FranâˆšÃŸois Fillon and Brice Hortefeux. I would have liked you to have mentioned the names, as then we would have seen that you, Mr Barroso, are taking up the fight. Above all, the basic values of the European Union - and much of what you said in this regard is right - include social justice. However, what is social justice in this Union?",5,3
280,"Integration is therefore taking place from the top downwards, but we also need to integrate from the bottom upwards and create a real Europe of the Regions. We need to do this by applying the subsidiarity protocol established in the Treaty of Lisbon which, according to the Commission's own data, has not been working over the past nine months, and by taking advantage of the experience and knowledge that the regions have in terms of innovation and competitiveness, because that will makes things better for Europe. Moreover, how are we going to be more innovative if, according to your data, the majority of the Member States are going to reduce their budgets for innovation? You do not talk about citizens very much: we need to be useful to them and really count on them if we want to bring the Union project closer to the European public.",40,2
38,"Over the next year, we will bring forward an energy action plan, an infrastructure package and an energy efficiency action plan to put this vision in place. I myself will travel to the Caspian region later this year to promote the Southern Corridor as a means of enhancing our security of supply. To build a resource-efficient Europe, we need to look beyond energy. In the 20th century, the world enjoyed phenomenal resource-intensive growth.",2,4
87,"In education and training? In security and defence? In our energy policy? While the United States, China and India are able to push forward fundamental or applied research, positioning themselves in tomorrow's markets, are we going to keep saying that we Europeans are too hesitant to pool our resources in order to achieve economies of scale and a leap forward in terms of efficiency?",4,1
184,"Mr President, I have listened to you all very closely and with great interest. I have tried to see which, essentially, were the fundamental questions. In substance, I believe that, at least, the majority of this Parliament clearly wants more Europe, wants the Community method and wants more ambition. No specific criticism was levelled at the Commission's proposals.",12,5
262,"Your report set out a very ambitious and committed programme for the forthcoming period and the European Parliament will surely look forward with anticipation to the measures you mention in the report. A minute is a very short time, and I would like to say only that the European Parliament - the Members of the European Parliament - may be your opponents, but we are constructive opponents and we want to help you implement what you have presented here. We could join forces against those who are the real brake on European Union integration, in other words, the European Council. We would like to offer you the hand of friendship and our assistance in your struggle against governments who promote national egotism, and who delay the development and further integration of the European Union through such national egotism.",33,5
222,"The five themes identified by the President of the Commission - exiting the crisis and improving economic governance, rediscovering the path to growth through the structural reforms of the Europe 2020 strategy, implementing the Stockholm Programme to strengthen the area of freedom, justice and internal security, modernising the Union budget and, finally, allowing Europe to take its place on the international stage - are fully consistent with the priorities of the trio, but also, obviously, with the priorities of the Belgian Presidency, brought before this assembly by the Prime Minister last July. However, realising these objectives will require time and therefore, several Presidencies will have to devote the necessary effort to this. The Presidency and the Council will study your speech in detail, Mr President, as well as the working document that accompanies it. At this stage, though, allow me to make two remarks.",18,4
59,"The more we are able to establish a common agenda, with a clearly defined European interest, the more we will achieve. For example, I see huge potential in developing a transatlantic agenda for growth and jobs. Where we are already punching our weight is the G20, the forum where the key economic global players address common challenges. When President Van Rompuy and I go to Seoul in November, representing the European Union, we want to see concrete results - further progress in global economic coordination, more stable and responsible financial markets and agreement on reform of international financial institutions, more effective global financial safety nets, and more progress on a G20 development agenda.",2,5
51,"As this Parliament has made clear, we must also address the issue of own resources. The present system is stretched to its limits - propped up by a byzantine set of corrections. Our citizens deserve a fairer and more efficient and more transparent system. Some will not agree with all the ideas we will raise.",2,2
21,Our goal is growth - sustainable and inclusive growth. This is our overarching priority. This is where we need to invest. Europe 2020 starts now.,2,5
10,"I cannot cover here every issue of European policy or initiative we will take. Through President Buzek, I will send you a more complete programme document. Essentially, I see five major challenges for the Union over the next year: dealing with the economic crisis and governance; restoring growth for jobs by accelerating the Europe 2020 reform agenda; building an area of freedom, justice and security; launching negotiations for a modern EU budget; and pulling our weight on the global stage. Let me start with the economic crisis and governance.",2,3
176,"Is it the Belgian Presidency? That really is good stuff! You still cannot form a government in your own country and yet you have the Presidency of the European Union! Whichever way you look at it, the whole thing is a bit of a dog's dinner really.",10,1
26,"We have very high levels of unemployment, but Europe now has four million job vacancies. Later this year, the Commission will propose a 'European Vacancy Monitor' which will show people where the jobs are in Europe and which skills are needed. We will also put forward plans for a European skills passport. We must also tackle problems of poverty and exclusion.",2,4
167,"I believe that the European Union has a good tradition. However, anyone who wants to combat social anxieties at the expense of a social minority, and indeed using unfair means, is abusing his political powers. I want to make this very clear: the abuse of social anxieties is simply unacceptable for a Community that always makes a point of standing up for universal human rights and moral values. These moral values and human rights apply to French, Polish, English, Spanish or German people in the European Union, just as they do for all Sinti and Roma who live in Europe.",9,3
247,"The social buffers that were put in place following the 1929 crisis are being dismantled in virtually every Member State. Your speech emphasised the social market economy and social cohesion, but your programme emphasises competition on the market and fiscal consolidation, which precludes a social market agenda. I want to see you using Articles 3, 9, 14 and Protocol 26 to their fullest legal and policy extent in order to develop a new social pact for Europe. Otherwise, we will not rebuild the confidence of the people of Europe and their unity behind developing the union of this Europe.",27,1
71,"I have set out how to modernise our social market economy to deliver growth and jobs in a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy through our Europe 2020 flagship initiatives. I have set out how to achieve a common energy policy in Europe. I have defended the need for an area of freedom, security and justice, where Europeans will find that their fundamental rights and obligations exist wherever they go. I have made clear that the Commission will strive for an ambitious budget.",2,5
102,"You can be sure that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will make such a request. We also expect you then to take the appropriate initiative. Mr â‰ˆâ€ emeta said that we do not need, and we will not get, a financial transaction tax. You say: 'I want the financial transaction tax'.",5,3
163,"Citizens have also seen rescue and economic recovery packages amounting to billions of euro flow to the so-called system-relevant banks, and they have seen dangerously high national debts pile up everywhere. Now they are asking themselves who is responsible for this, particularly when, despite a better economic outlook, they are being hit by the Member States' austerity measures. These austerity measures will result in rising prices for public services, cuts in social benefits, cuts in education services, pay cuts, an extended working life in the face of uncertain pensions and often precarious employment situations. The protest goes far beyond the states hit by the crisis.",9,1
1,"Mr President, honourable Members, it is a great privilege to deliver the first State of the Union address before this House. From now on, the State of the Union address will be the occasion when we will chart our work for the next 12 months. Many of the decisions we will take in the next year will have long-term implications. They will define the kind of Europe we want.",2,5
210,"However, it is also the obligation of every state to investigate each individual case and not to create the impression that whole population groups are suspect from the start. We find this unacceptable. My final comment is that you must not take guerrilla action. You have already said that I am taking institutional guerrilla action.",14,2
