122,"We have an excellent report on this by Mario Monti, and our message is very simple: let us act on this report. Because it is incomprehensible, for example, that today it still takes more than 40 hours to travel by train from central and eastern European countries to Brussels, Paris or Amsterdam. How are these people supposed to feel connected to the European Union? How can these markets be fully integrated?",6,1
92,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agenda item is entitled 'Statement by the President of the Commission on the State of the Union'. Today, we have heard about a work programme, and an ambitious and committed one. We have heard little about a stocktake, about the actual state of the Union. What then is the state of the Union today?",5,2
264,"Madam President, the President of the Commission talked about sustainable growth and a target of 75% employment across the EU, a goal we would all agree with. Yet across the EU, drastic cuts in public services are adding to the numbers of unemployed, taking money out of the economy and reducing essential services. How does this help the economy and avoid a job crisis? It really does not make sense.",34,1
66,"What really matters is what the institutions deliver to the people. What matters is the difference Europe makes in their daily lives. The secret of Europe's success is its unique Community model. More than ever, the Commission must drive the political agenda with its vision and proposals.",2,4
279,"Madam President, Europe needs to convert its good intentions into actions, Mr Barroso. The role of the leadership provided by the permanent President of the Union must be acknowledged because he has played a decisive role in the agreement on financial supervision. This is the way forward for the Member States to agree on economic and foreign policy strategies, which are only effective if there is a common position. Otherwise, we will continue to lose positions and international visibility both in peace and security, and in economic and social matters.",40,3
89,"The time has definitely come for Europe to use its own resources. Let us not be afraid of these words. In addition, the question of a European tax must not be taboo. This is not about creating a tax to be added to national taxes; on the contrary, it is about achieving economies of scale and making sure that public funds as a whole are spent in a better way, and thus, ultimately, reducing charges on households and businesses.",4,4
123,"Let us invest in trans-European networks. The fourth important priority, and maybe the most important message for today, concerns the budget and the new financial framework. Let us be very clear about this. The aim of some national governments to reduce the budget by 20% or 30% is ridiculous at a time when what is needed is more European solutions.",6,2
254,"Right, but it is not a one-way street; companies cannot shoulder all the financial sacrifices alone, to the benefit of their non-European competitors. Protect minority rights? It is the right thing to do, but when the members of those minorities do not respect our laws, it is right to send them back to their own countries. We cannot think of becoming a gathering point for the desperate people of the world; we must help them in their own countries.",30,2
178,"Mr President, perhaps I might also be permitted to use both of my speaking times together to speak for three minutes. The European project - if we are debating the state of the Union - seems to many people right across Europe to be in serious jeopardy in four respects. The prosperity and the social security of Europe seem to people to be at risk. The financial crisis and the - perhaps futile - help given to Greece have proven that to people, while the increasing mass unemployment and the mass immigration into our social systems also prove this to them.",11,2
200,"Mr President, I will use my two minutes to try to go back to the questions and answer them. I will not make any personal attacks. You know me: I will not make them and I have never made them. First, regarding the budget and what we have agreed together, the vast majority of Parliament agrees that we need our own budget so that we can reduce the resources used at national level.",13,3
223,"The first is that what our fellow citizens expect from our institutions is to put our projects into concrete form, which will allow them to contemplate the future more calmly. Effective financial supervision and regulation, an affordable and competitive Community patent, and an operational European diplomatic service are among the urgent projects on which our three institutions will be judged. Next, let me stress that only collective, Community-based work by our institutions - the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, the President of the European Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy - will make these types of projects possible, and it will perhaps also allow us to combat the Euroscepticism which continues to gain ground in the Member States. This is why the Belgian Presidency has proposed, Mr President, to strengthen cooperation with the European Parliament on implementing current priorities.",18,5
147,"That is the situation the world finds itself in, Mr Barroso.",7,2
96,"However, you will have three quarters of the members of the Council against you if you talk about own resources. I am now eager to see whether you follow what you have said today with action and take up the fight against the intergovernmentalisation of the European Union. I will give you an example. I agree with you that Europe will only succeed if we defend our elementary values.",5,2
272,"A simple, transparent legal environment with a modest bureaucratic burden would certainly deliver a strong new impulse to Europe, further boosting economic growth. I would like to ask you, Mr Barroso, please, to give some thought to this matter.",37,4
145,"I would say to you, Mr Barroso: put Keynes in Brussels. Public investment today must be European investment in the ecological transformation of our economy. Do you understand this, Mr Barroso? If so, I hope that, in the next discussion about Europe, you will show that you have understood that we are no longer in the 1970s, but today we face a financial crisis and an ecological crisis.",7,2
101,"I expect you to come up with proposals for how we can eliminate this social divide. I therefore say to you that the financial transaction tax must be put in place. We must involve the banks, particularly the speculation sector, in the aftermath of the economic crisis. We have concluded an interinstitutional agreement, Mr Barroso, to the effect that, if this Parliament, with a legislative majority, calls on the Commission to submit a corresponding proposal for a directive, you have agreed that you will do so.",5,4
143,"You spoke, for example, of European investment. You can look at the time; I have three more minutes. I know it is annoying, but that is life. I wanted to say one thing to you: take things seriously.",7,2
139,Is the Commission waiting? Does it have a report in its filing cabinet? Say it publicly: what France is doing contravenes the European treaties. It really is simple to say it and to make it known.,7,1
228,Will this catching-up trend continue in these countries? Will a multi-speed Europe evolve? Will the new Central European and Baltic States have an opportunity to catch up? Will there be enough resources after 2014?,20,2
245,"It fought hard to join the European Union. So why are you undermining and circumventing this vision, which is also your vision? Why are you allowing an attempt to be made to dismantle the basic principles and values on which the Union is based? I refer to the case of Cyprus, where your insistence on the application of Article 207 of the Treaty of Lisbon to the direct trade regulation infringes the Treaty of Accession and, in particular, Protocol 10 on the accession of the whole of Cyprus to the European Union, and deals a severe blow to the sovereignty of Cyprus and, at the same time, solidarity towards the Member States and the credibility of the Union.",26,1
253,"Good, so let us help companies and workers with subsidies for new economic growth and with proper salaries and pensions; let us create a European energy market. Europe is ageing? That is too bad, let us help traditional families made up of men and women to have children with contributions and services. Step up the fight against climate change?",30,4
130,"Mr President, I will do the same as Mr Verhofstadt: I will use all my speaking time at once. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Schulz and Mr Verhofstadt have pointed out the fundamental difficulty of our situation, and I regret that you have not had the clear-headedness or truthfulness to point it out. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, there has been a battle concerning the interpretation of the treaty. I believe that most governments had not read it, and, once it was introduced, they discovered that the Treaty of Lisbon was actually a means and an instrument for the communitisation of European policies.",7,1
114,"It is therefore no surprise to me, nor, I think, to others here in Parliament, that public confidence in Europe has dropped dramatically. You can see this in the latest Eurobarometer, which shows that less than half of our citizens think that their country's membership is a good thing. Trust in our institutions dropped last year to 42%. This is the State of the Union today.",6,1
58,"Copenhagen showed that, while others did not match our ambition, we did not help ourselves by not speaking with one voice. Negotiations may have stalled but climate change has not. I want us to intensify our engagement with international partners to turn their press releases into credible commitments to cut emissions and push forward with fast-start funding. The next two months will see crucial summits with strategic partners.",2,3
100,"On the one hand, we have an increasing number of income millionaires - there are thousands more every year - and, on the other, we have millions of people who are being reduced to poverty. This social divide is the greatest threat to democracy in Europe. In August, the Guardian published statistics which revealed that HSBC, Barclays Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland made more than EUR 20 billion in profit last year, EUR 9 billion of which they are putting aside as bonuses for their managers. This is happening at a time when the governments in the European Union are cutting pensions in Europe.",5,1
282,"The policy that we, as the European Union, follow on issues relating to the movement of persons within the Union and to entry and exit from third countries is unacceptable. We cannot pursue this policy of a besieged and timid Europe. The free movement of persons is fundamental. It has always been so, and it is the foundation on which our present-day societies are built.",41,1
7,"The unemployment problem is an extremely serious one. Budgetary expansion played its role to counter the decline in economic activity. But it is now time to exit. Without structural reforms, we will not create sustainable growth.",2,2
265,"It puts the recovery at risk, a risk that is being taken, by the way, in my own country, the UK, by the Cameron Government. Maintaining investment in areas the EU has a potential to lead in, such as renewable energies and high-speed rail, will help create the Europe we want, it will help create the Europe we need, and it will help secure the economy. Finally, we need to guarantee overseas aid budgets, which are actually seen by some as an easy target. Those countries that fall short, far short, of their target pledges, should be strongly encouraged to rethink this disastrous policy.",34,3
216,"Mr President, I would like to come back to what Mr Barroso so rightly said against racism and xenophobia. However, in this regard, I would like to say that I am still not satisfied with the debate about the Roma, which we will, of course, continue this afternoon. There are side issues being debated that are extremely dangerous. In Germany, for example, we currently have the Sarrazin debate, which is extremely problematic.",16,1
47,"We should invest it where it leverages growth and delivers our European agenda. The quality of spending should be the yardstick for us all. It is important to discuss not only the quantity, but also the quality, of the spending and investment. I believe that Europe offers real added value.",2,5
107,"We will come to help you. Social justice also means that we must not leave the next generation a continent in which it is no longer worth living. You are right, therefore: for social justice, we also need a new, sustainable industrial policy that combines environmental and economic concerns. This is the right approach.",5,5
84,"It is unacceptable that, in the 21st century, we still have draconian rules which no longer have anything to do with the reality of Europe. The second is to take a more serious attitude in our common external policy and, as you have repeatedly said, to become a more respected actor in the world. We can no longer be content with saying that Europe is complicated, that it takes time and that we must be patient. We can also no longer be content with being the primary global donor without being able to guarantee that the aid that we send arrives at its destination along with Mr Putin's and Mr Obama's helicopters.",4,2
183,"Inwardly harsh and regimented towards its citizens, employing centralism and bureaucracy, and outwardly a Europe that is weak, has no place in the world, and is not capable of really securing European interests globally. That is the state of the Union, a Union that is no longer really prepared to secure the interests of the European peoples and the interests of European citizens.",11,1
211,"That is absolutely not the case. You should be carrying out institutional frontal attacks - that is what it comes down to, Mr Barroso. Our criticism of you does not relate to your very definite ability to find consensus. You are certainly capable of that.",14,1
57,"In our globalised world, the relationships we build with strategic partners determine our prosperity. To be effective on the international stage, we need the weight of the European Union. Size matters, now more than ever. A good example is the fight against climate change.",2,99
67,"I have called for a special relationship between the Commission and Parliament, the two Community institutions par excellence. I am intensifying my political cooperation with you. Europe is not only Brussels or Strasbourg. It is also our regions.",2,2
220,"Every single one of the policies fails and leads to a problem - whether it is this or whether it is the euro - and all the way through, we see a fanatical political ambition to create a United States of Europe, regardless of the consequences. At no time has any of this been endorsed by the voting public. That, Mr Barroso, is the true state of the Union.",17,1
46,"Honourable Members, another challenge for next year is sorting out the future budget of the European Union. Next month, we will put forward the Commission's first ideas for the budget review. It will launch an open debate without taboos to prepare our legislative proposals that will be presented in the second quarter of next year. We need to spend our money where we get most value for it.",2,4
14,"We need to tackle severe macro-economic imbalances, especially in the euro area. That is why we made proposals early on to detect asset bubbles, lack of competitiveness and other sources of imbalances. I now see a willingness on the part of governments to accept stronger monitoring, backed up by incentives for compliance and earlier sanctions. The Commission will strengthen its role as an independent referee and enforcer of the new rules.",2,5
237,"Mr President, the state of the Union for us today, in France, is that the citizens, the people, and also the streets are rumbling with discontent. Our fellow European citizens are experiencing an unprecedented crisis of confidence, and they have decided to march to the beat of refusal and demands, but also of hope. What is behind this is a failed proposal for reforming pensions, but not only this. What is at stake is getting older in a dignified manner.",24,2
196,"That is why I believe that we have an immense amount of work to do. If the criticism that some people have directed at me is that I am seeking consensus between the main European political forces, then that is a criticism that I am happy to accept. In fact, the Commission must represent the general European interest, and we must try to represent this same general interest by trying to obtain the contribution of different pro-European political forces. That is what we are doing.",12,4
36,"Even with the Internet, over a third of consumers lack the confidence to make cross-border purchases. At my request, Mario Monti presented an excellent report and has identified 150 missing links and bottlenecks in the internal market. Next month, we will set out how to deepen the Single Market in a comprehensive and ambitious Single Market Act. Energy is a key driver for growth and a central priority for action.",2,3
215,"This is obvious. However, we need to avoid a situation in which any ethnic group is, in any way, attributed with a particular predisposition to crime, because that is, in my opinion, very dangerous and verges on racial discrimination. These are matters which need to be treated tactfully, and they must not be politicised by either side in the dispute. What is needed is a constructive approach, and the problem needs to be resolved.",15,2
146,"To conclude, I will give you a figure which we must all reflect on. The losses due to the crisis are reaching EUR 50 000 billion. This is equivalent to five centuries of public investment in development aid. That would build 10 billion schools in the African countries.",7,1
68,"It is the cities, towns and villages you come from. When you walk round your constituencies, you can point to the European projects that are so important for their prosperity. At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat - the European institutions, Member States and regions. The Union will not achieve its objectives in Europe without the Member States and the Member States will not achieve their objectives in the world without the European Union.",2,4
70,"One thing is certain - it is not through pessimism and constantly promoting defeat that we will win this battle; it is with confidence and with a strong common will. Today, I have outlined how I see the European Union doing that. I have committed myself to delivering the proposals to build our economic union. I have made the case to fast-track our reform agenda.",2,5
155,"They are elected by the citizens of the European Union, and we are defending the rights of those governments to represent their citizens in the Union arena. We want a balance between Union affairs and national affairs in Europe, and this is why we are going to defend the idea of the nation-state, in the context, of course, of the European Union. However, in saying this, I would like to say that I agree with everything that has been said in this Chamber. I say this, now, from the bottom of my heart.",8,3
224,We have planned regular meetings at an administrative as well as a political level in order to intensify our collaboration. It is in this spirit that the Presidency intends to pursue its work over the next four months.,18,4
42,"This trend is set to intensify. Our European Digital Agenda will deliver a single digital market worth 4% of EU GDP by 2020. Mr President, everything we do is for the citizens of Europe. A fundamental dimension of our European project is building an area of freedom, security and justice.",2,5
78,"They understand that we also need more Europe to reduce inequalities and to strengthen our European social model, our social market economy. We therefore need more Europe, not to interfere in the details of everyday life, but to address our common challenges together in a much more efficient way, and - a question I will come back to - in a more profitable and less costly way. As I was saying, our fellow citizens are wondering why Europe is not more efficient and more organised, and why it is not listened to more on the world stage. They quite rightly expect that the economic and financial efforts which they have been asked to make will bear fruit, and that we will bring everyone out of the difficulties together.",4,2
293,"It will clearly be a very complex debate, in an extremely difficult economic situation. If the Member States cannot increase their contribution, resources will have to be found so that the European Union can deliver results. What we cannot do is ask Europe to deliver results without giving it the resources to do so. It would be impossible to do that, and so we must have an extremely serious debate on this issue of solidarity and subsidiarity.",42,2
209,"In this respect, Bernard Kouchner is right in what he said. My second point is that states governed by the rule of law have an obligation to prosecute criminal acts. If something is stolen or if prostitution or fraud is going on, a state governed by the rule of law must enforce the law, no matter who is suspected of having committed the deed. That is the right of every state.",14,99
82,"Europe has also played a pioneering role in the fight against global warming. It really needs to be said: the Copenhagen conference left a bitter taste in the mouth. Our ambitions are unchanged, and the cap is now fixed for good. We can be proud of that.",4,4
124,"I can fully understand that, when confronted with a huge fiscal deficit, they want to cut their direct contributions to the Union. That is a normal, spontaneous reaction. Hence, our proposal to replace these national contributions with European own resources. That takes me to the fifth priority: our credibility in the world.",6,2
13,Debt and deficit lead to boom and bust and they unravel the social safety net. Money that is spent on servicing debt is money that cannot be spent on the social good nor to prepare ourselves for the costs of an ageing population. A debt generation makes an unsustainable nation. Our proposals will strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact through increased surveillance and enforcement.,2,3
201,"This is the first summary that I am making, but let us not forget that we are dealing with a unanimous decision. This is not about criticising our Heads of State or Government, or Mrs Lagarde or Mr Sch√§uble; this is about convincing our respective parties, as Mr Barroso said; this is about properly discussing and properly working with this subject at our respective levels, in our respective parties and in our respective countries, as these are unanimous decisions. This will be much more complicated than making grand speeches here, but we will fight, and I will fight to have our own resources at European level. Second, regarding the Roma, let us call a spade a spade.",13,2
162,"Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have provided an impressive insight into the tasks of the various policy areas. Nevertheless, you, and all of us here, have to admit that the trust of European citizens is fading. Mr Verhofstadt has drawn our attention to this and so I will not address the matter in any more detail. These are reliable studies.",9,1
300,"A confidence issue not just at European level, but among political institutions in general. This means that all political decision makers are faced with a major challenge and a major responsibility. I believe that it is precisely by demonstrating strength of conviction that it is possible to have both serious responses and strong responses; not to take the weak middle ground, not to reach false consensus, but to have the courage to uphold, for Europe, this policy of balance, this policy of respect for the differences that exist in Europe. There are differences in Europe.",42,2
117,"It is a second term that needs a new vision and also new answers. It is, in any case, time to change into a higher gear, and to realise important reforms now. From the point of view of our group, there are principally seven big, important reforms. The first thing to do is to finalise our response to the financial crisis.",6,3
303,"We work hard every day in the interests of Europe. I believe that, with you, the representatives directly elected by our fellow citizens, we can do more for a Europe that represents this spirit, a Europe of solidarity, a Europe of conviction, a Europe that is, at the same time, the Europe of the single market and the Europe of cohesion.",42,5
62,Human rights are not negotiable. I am shocked at how the rights of women are being infringed in many countries. I am appalled when I hear that Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani has been sentenced to death by stoning. This is barbaric beyond words.,2,1
35,"What they both need is an open and modern single market. The internal market is Europe's greatest asset, and we are not using it enough. We urgently need to deepen it. Only 8% of Europe's 20 million SMEs engage in cross-border trade, still fewer in investment.",2,2
95,"For during your period of office, you have been making concessions for far too long, particularly after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, concessions to a developing directorial government in Europe, in the Council, under German-French leadership. It is your job to defend the Community method. Much of what you have said here in your address is right, and you can be assured of the support of three quarters of this House. This is the case.",5,2
238,"What is at stake is ensuring an intergenerational solidarity which allows the youngest people today also to live their working life, their professional life, with a pension from which they can benefit. On this very subject, Mr Barroso, the Commission published a Green Paper on the reform of pension systems which unleashed a wave of anxiety from the trade unions before the summer. The proposal that you have made to increase the retirement age seems unrealistic to me. It would be more useful if the Commission told us how we can make sure that workers are able to keep their jobs up to the legal retirement age.",24,2
56,"If we do not act together, Europe will not be a force in the world and they will move on without us - without the European Union but also without its Member States. This is why, in my political guidelines, I called for Europe to be a global player and a global leader - a key task and test for our generation. Together with High Representative and Vice-President Ashton, I will present our vision of how we can maximise Europe's role in the world. With the European External Action Service, we have the means to match our aspirations.",2,4
19,"I want to thank Parliament for the constructive role it has played and I hope it will give its final agreement this month. We will also go further on regulation. Initiatives on derivatives, further measures on credit rating agencies and a framework for bank resolution and crisis management will soon be before you. Our goal is to have a reformed financial sector in place by the end of 2011.",2,4
287,"That is one good example. As you will no doubt recall, when the Commission presented the idea, a few months ago, of having a European Semester, or a period at the start of the year when we work together to prepare our budgets, to see how we can actually coordinate economic policies, straight away, there was a great deal of reaction by certain well-known individuals, who were saying that this undermined national sovereignty and that it even undermined the national parliaments. This was completely untrue. The truth is that, ultimately, thanks to the work that was also done by the task force chaired by Mr Van Rompuy, thanks to the proposals strongly supported by the Commission and the Council, and with the ongoing support of this House, we have succeeded.",42,5
125,"We have the External Action Service, but what we need now, and what we have asked Lady Ashton, the Vice-President of the Commission (it would be better if she were here), is also to develop a new strategy for the Union. Our external policy strategy is still based on a paper by Javier Solana dating from 2003. The world has changed since 2003, and our strategic framework should also be adapted and modernised. That brings me to climate change.",6,2
60,We will continue to show leadership in this forum and work closely with the French G8/G20 Presidency next year. We also want to see support for the Doha Round. Trade boosts growth and prosperity. We will also pursue bilateral and regional Free Trade Agreements.,2,4
136,"We have all gone completely mad, as I have said three or four times, but will we act? Do you know how much money Greece has spent on arms these past ten years? What is the figure? EUR 50 billion in ten years!",7,1
239,"I would like to hear your proposals, and I would also like to hear some details on what you called the fiscal consolidation rather than the economic coordination of our Member States, which I think must be oriented towards social solidarity.",24,3
198,"Therefore, I ask for your help and support so that we can explain, in our countries, to the political forces which form the governments in our capitals, why - as Mr Daul rightly said, by the way - very often the euros that we spend at European level in fact constitute a saving compared with the many euros that we might spend at national level. This battle with public opinion is one that we must win, by having a democratic debate in our countries. This is why I ask for your support so that this debate can take place with the political forces that you represent, not just in Strasbourg or Brussels, but also in the capitals, because we must reach a consensus between Parliament and the Council. The various institutions must reach an agreement.",12,4
99,"You described the dramatic growth in unemployment in Europe. This growth in unemployment will lead to a process of mass impoverishment and to a risk scenario for people. More and more people - including those still in work - are afraid: afraid for their jobs, afraid for their social stability and afraid for their future. This needs to be illustrated with figures.",5,2
185,"Some people have said that they would have preferred a speech analysing the situation. Rather than commenting on the past and the present, I prefer to construct the future. I believe that the most important thing is not to comment - I leave that to the commentators, for whom I have a lot of respect, by the way - but I believe that our role, the role of the Commission, is to make proposals. For me, the speech on the state of the Union also concerns the state to which we want to lead the Union with our joint efforts.",12,3
133,"This Commission, in its general statements, is the champion of Europe. They are very beautiful statements. However, when it comes to pointing the finger, describing a situation affecting a Member State, naming someone or a government by name, you are conspicuously silent. You do not exist.",7,3
120,"That is a nonsensical situation - even worse, it is a dangerous situation. We cannot afford to be one Union and, at the same time, to have 27 different economic strategies, as we do today. It is crystal clear that if we want the Stability and Growth Pact and the new economic strategy to be a success, we need a serious carrot and stick approach, with proper sanctions. In my opinion - and I think in the opinion of the majority of this House - it is good that the Council is thinking about this in connection with a task force, but that cannot replace the right of initiative of the Commission, and the duty of the Commission to come forward as fast as possible with a global legislative proposal on economic governance.",6,2
189,"We are currently experiencing an extremely difficult time from an economical and social point of view, and this is a time when everyone must show responsibility. We know well that, at difficult economic times, the tendency is for public opinion to have little confidence in political institutions, either at national or European level. I believe that the best way of responding to these worries is with results and with proposals. In essence, I believe that we are in agreement - at least, the pro-European majority in the European Parliament is.",12,3
138,"This is my example, Mr Barroso, of the non-intervention of your Commission. I can give you a second example, which was provided by Mr Verhofstadt. Today, what is happening with the Roma is a test of the credibility of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which forms part of the Treaty of Lisbon. To put it in a moral and philosophical way, I quote Albert Camus: 'Democracy is about defending minorities, not simply executing the will of majorities'.",7,1
128,"I would even say that they are using dubious methods to confuse issues when it comes to migration. I would like to say most emphatically that I find this attitude to be incompatible with the principles and values that make our Union one of the most beautiful and one of the greatest political ideas to which the human spirit and heart have given birth. Mr President, I intend to say it emphatically: the Roma are European citizens, fully-fledged citizens. We can never accept their rights being violated - never - in a world racked with all manner of uncertainties.",6,2
302,"They are justifiable. Looking beyond these ideological differences, however, can we or can we not have a strong consensus in favour of Europe? I believe that we can. The Commission reaches consensus every day; my colleagues, from 27 countries, have different cultural and national backgrounds, and different ideologies.",42,4
234,"Mr President, as the President of the Commission acknowledges, belief that the EU is a good thing has fallen substantially, and many people believe their Member States have not benefited from membership. We should be worried, but I fear that the Commission is under pressure from those who believe that the solution to every crisis is more Europe. Indeed, some argue that polls demonstrate support for more European economic governance. However, the public does not want more Europe; it wants a better Europe and a Europe that adds value with a light touch.",22,3
141,"There was nothing on that. You did not talk about Canc√∫n. We have three months until Canc√∫n. There was not a word on the fact that if we want to be credible on climate change, we must return to a 30% target for reduction in CO2, and we must be at the forefront of the debate on climate change.",7,1
9,"Europe must show that it is more than 27 different national solutions. We either swim together or sink separately. We will only succeed if, whether acting nationally, regionally or locally, we think European. Today, I will set out what I see as the priorities for our work together over the coming year.",2,3
129,"I believe that this Europe must remain a continent of freedom, tolerance and justice. Mr President, the Commission, the guardian of the treaties, must react uncompromisingly. This is not just its right; it is an institutional duty.",6,2
23,"Over 6.3 million people have lost their jobs since 2008. Each one of them should have the chance to get back into employment. Europe's employment rates are at 69% on average for those aged between 20 and 64. We have agreed that these should rise to 75% by 2020, bringing, in particular, more women and older workers into the workforce.",2,3
31,"We need to improve Europe's innovation performance not only in universities but along the whole chain, from research to retail, notably through innovation partnerships. We need an Innovation Union. Next month, the Commission will set out how to achieve this. Another key test will be whether Member States are ready to make a breakthrough on a patent valid across the whole European Union.",2,2
88,"At the moment, we are forcing our researchers to leave Europe. We must absolutely make sure that our researchers want to come back and stay in Europe. Mr Barroso, these are the real issues that we, Parliament and the Commission, must put on the table when we talk about negotiations on the financing of European projects for 2014-2020. These are the questions that our fellow citizens are asking themselves, and to which they are expecting serious answers.",4,2
131,"In all the discussions, the battle which is taking place - we have seen it on foreign services, we have seen it on the situation of financial regulation - always gets to the same point. The question at issue is - and it has already been said - are we moving towards an intergovernmental Europe or a strengthening of the Community-based Europe? This is precisely the situation of the Union today. What I dream of is that the Commission will make a public declaration.",7,2
115,"That is alarming but, at the same time, we have to recognise that it is not surprising. Parliament urged European leaders many times to end the standstill on Europe, to move forward, to quit protectionism and nationalism and to work on European solutions. That is also what the European citizens are asking for because, if you look at the same Eurobarometer, you see that no less than 86% of the public want European economic governance. They believe that only the Union can provide solutions to the financial and economic crisis.",6,2
40,"This means integrating the different strands of policy on climate change, energy, transport and environment into a coherent approach on resource efficiency and a low carbon future. A forward-looking agricultural sector will play a major role in European measures to address some of the biggest challenges ahead, such as global food security, biodiversity loss and the sustainable management of natural resources. So will our maritime policy. All of this will not only strengthen our economy tomorrow, but will provide new openings today.",2,4
227,"Mr President, since the international financial crisis and economic downturn, new divisions have emerged in the European Union. There are no longer any grounds for making distinctions between old and new Member States. President Barroso has not mentioned the reason why the gulf is beginning to deepen between the eastern and southern parts of the EU. Before accession, we in the new Member States saw Ireland, Spain and Portugal's success in catching up with the rest of Europe as an inspiring example.",20,2
174,"And, in your own country, well, why should the German taxpayer increasingly pick up the bill? This form of government is not working, and yet what we heard today is that we are going to have a common defence policy and a common foreign policy. The other reason why these polls are where they are is that people do not respect you because you cheated to get the Lisbon Treaty through. We were told it would simplify everything, that we would know where we stand.",10,1
212,"You have seen today that everyone is satisfied with you. In your personal conversations, Mr Barroso, you are definitely capable of attack - something that your commissioners and I myself know very well. However, I would ask you for once to show the ability to go publicly on the offensive, specifically in relation to the Heads of State or Government, because that is what we need in Europe, an element that is willing to confront those who want to renationalise Europe. To you, Mr Farage, I would say this: it may well be that I do not know how it works, that people are freely stuffing their pockets, but I know very well how to put an end to these people's games.",14,2
219,"Mr President, the row over the Roma in France is, of course, caused directly by failing European Union policies. It was a huge mistake to allow Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union whilst there were millions of Roma in those countries being heavily discriminated against. It is no wonder that, now they are part of the Union, they are seeking to move elsewhere. That goes for everything does it not?",17,1
203,"Nevertheless, serious crime is to be deplored. I did not say that it was the Roma. Do not put words in my mouth. What we must fight against are banditry, crime and prostitution.",13,1
75,"What have we done successfully together these past few years, and in what ways have we failed? What plans do we have? What political means and, in particular, what financial means will we make available for implementing them? Mr President, this debate is welcome, and I am happy that Parliament and the Commission, the two Community institutions which represent and defend the general European interest, are this morning participating in this exercise, which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) would like to be a forward-looking one.",4,3
154,"This is a fact which must not be ignored. How, therefore, can Europe speak with one voice on the global stage if different European governments speak with different voices? Ladies and gentlemen, let us not deceive ourselves - that is how it will be. You can, while sitting in this Chamber, close your eyes and pretend that those 27 governments do not exist, but they do.",8,2
33,"We will also act further on red tape. SMEs are being strangled in regulatory knots. 71% of CEOs say that the biggest barrier to their success is bureaucracy. The Commission has put proposals on the table to generate annual savings of EUR 38 billion for European companies. Stimulating innovation, cutting red tape and developing a highly-skilled workforce: these are ways to ensure that European manufacturing continues to be world class.",2,4
6,"Clearly, uncertainties and risks remain, not least outside the European Union. We should be under no illusions. Our work is far from finished. There is no room for complacency.",2,2
113,"Mr President, the State of the Union means, first of all, looking back and learning the lessons of the past, and then looking to the future. Let us be honest with ourselves and say that last year was a very difficult year for the Union. It was a difficult year for the Union because there were big problems, but little unity to solve those problems. Greece was on the brink of collapse, the euro itself was under attack for months, and it took several months for the European governments to finally agree to save a Member State and to save our common currency.",6,2
226,"That is why we have to solve the problem of high-level public debt now and take painful measures to this end, and that is why we cannot accept a 20% unemployment rate among young people. This percentage has now been laid down in the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, but this will mean that disadvantaged children and children from minorities continue to be marginalised. Therefore, the Council faces the challenge of increasing youth employment, in order to meet Parliament's ambition of 90% of young people in either work or education and just 10% youth unemployment. Achieving this by 2020 is a very important objective for our European Union.",19,3
112,"If you fight against the insidious intergovernmentalisation and if you actively defend the Community approach, then you can count on us. If not, we will bring you to account at the time of the next report on the state of the Union.",5,2
278,"We need to make a stand for the prohibition of discrimination, for the principle of pacta sunt servanda and for solidarity. We need more acts of solidarity and we need these acts of solidarity to be regarded not as costs but as investments.",39,3
28,The Commission will address persistent obstacles as early as this autumn. Growth must be based on our companies' competitiveness. We should continue to make life easier for our small and medium-sized enterprises. They provide two out of every three private sector jobs.,2,4
116,"However, they do not see this happening today, and that is the reason for their disappointment in our Union. I know that for the Commission, too, it has been a difficult year, because in fact, it has only been half a year. That is how long it has taken our capitals to realise that there is a new treaty and a new way of working, and also a new balance of power in the Union. We can therefore say that today is the real start of the President of the Commission's second term.",6,3
30,"Investing in innovation also means promoting world-class universities in Europe. I want to see them attracting the brightest and the best, from Europe and the rest of the world. We will take an initiative on the modernisation of European universities. I want to see a Europe that is strong in science, education and culture.",2,5
104,"Europe also needs education, qualifications and opportunities for advancement. Someone who is born poor in this Union must not remain in the ghetto in which he lives. We need opportunities for advancement. For these opportunities, it is important that Europe plays its part in contributing to education, qualifications and equal opportunities for young people in particular.",5,4
188,"We have made proposals on this, and it is here, I believe, that we will truly be able to test our commitment to a stronger Europe. Some people provided results of opinion polls measuring support for or confidence in the European institutions. It is true that there are difficulties - serious difficulties - to which we should respond. However, if you had made a more complete analysis, you would have noticed that, while confidence in the European institutions sometimes poses problems, there is sometimes a much greater problem, which is confidence in national politicians and national governments, and the truth is that no one has mentioned this.",12,2
192,"Let me say to you, however, that the Commission has been interested in this problem for a long time. At the start of this year, we even co-organised a ministerial meeting on the issue of the Roma. I believe that only two or three ministers, for the whole of Europe, were present at this ministerial meeting. Mrs Reding represented the Commission.",12,1
181,"Thirdly, people feel that cultural diversity and the national identity of the European peoples are at risk. Cultural assimilation and spiritual globalisation will have this effect, as will mass immigration, and so will Islamification and abuse of the asylum system, of course. The national identity of the European peoples is probably in serious jeopardy. Fourthly, respect for Europe in the world is in serious jeopardy.",11,1
90,"Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the European and international dimension is evidence for the young generations, who are not expecting long speeches from us, but rather solutions to their problems and perspectives for their future. It must be our main objective to guarantee education and training for 15-25 year-olds. Stabilising our public finances and investing in innovation, opening new doors to allow them to make use of their talents in Europe, not necessarily in other countries - these are the priorities which must guide our actions and on which our fellow citizens will judge us. Mr President, Commissioners, you must make proposals to us, and here I will repeat the words of a man that you all know, John Paul II: 'Have no fear'.",4,3
244,"Mr President, sometimes you do see us, up here, at the top of the Himalayas. President of the Commission, your vision of a Europe of justice, freedom, democracy, prosperity and a high standard of modern political morals is very important. I wish I had time to analyse what Mr Kaminski said, but time is too short. This vision is also our vision, which is why my small country, Cyprus, has given a great deal for freedom and democracy in Europe and in the world.",26,99
179,"In this regard, the Union comes across to people as a toothless tiger that is not able to exercise control of the financial markets or to develop appropriate criteria. Secondly, people feel that civil freedom is at risk. There is barely any direct democracy in the Union. It is treated with contempt, like, for example, in the first Irish referendum or in the referendums in France and the Netherlands.",11,2
257,"The individual nation states of Europe, and the European Union on behalf of the continent as a whole, are committing identity, and economic, suicide.",31,1
69,"The citizens of Europe expect us to take the action needed to get out of this crisis. We must show them that the common efforts we are making today will lead to new jobs, new investments, and a Europe fit for the future. I am confident that Europe has what it takes. We will get the results we are reaching for.",2,5
72,"I have proposed developing EU project bonds to finance major European projects. I have announced our reinforced commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. I have made the case clear as to why we need a common crisis response capacity, a common foreign policy and a common defence policy. I have urged European leaders to act together if they want Europe to be a global player and defend the European interest.",2,3
158,"I believe in Europe, and we, the European Conservatives, believe in the Union. However, we believe in the Union in its diversity. We do not believe that there is one new united state which is supposed to fuse into a single nation. This plan will not be accepted.",8,2
157,"I willingly acknowledge this, although I am not a great enthusiast of the Union, but I do appreciate this. This is something which must be maintained. I would also like to say that we must be more open and credible in what we deliver to the European Union's citizens. The greatest problem of our Community is that one thing is said in our declarations, while the facts and what the citizens see being done is something completely different.",8,2
52,"Indeed, I find it extraordinary that some are already rejecting them, without even knowing what they will be. I know that one issue of interest to this Parliament is the duration of the next budget. Various options exist. I would like to look at a 10-year framework, with a mid-term review of the financial dimension after five years.",2,99
249,"While no one is forcing the President of the European Council to come and address the European Parliament, no one is stopping him either. I should like to hear you speak on this point, President Barroso, and to name those people for whom Mr Van Rompuy's presence might be a nuisance.",28,2
29,"Among their main concerns are innovation and red tape. We are working on both. Just before the summer, the Commission announced the biggest ever package from the Seventh Research Framework Programme, worth EUR 6.4 billion. This money will go to SMEs as well as to scientists.",2,4
301,"There are differences between our Member States; their national interests are sometimes at odds with each other. That is the truth, and it is only right that governments should defend their national interests. The question is: how can we show that they can achieve more at national level if Europe, too, is stronger? There are also, at times, ideological differences.",42,2
43,"We are working hard to implement the Stockholm action plan. We will make a real push on asylum and migration. Legal migrants will find Europe a place where human values are respected and enforced. At the same time, we will crack down on the exploitation of illegal immigrants within Europe and at our borders.",2,4
271,"Mr Barroso, in your report on the state of the Union, you placed particular emphasis on the future economic management of Europe, perhaps because Europe is still not managing to keep pace with the dynamically developing economies of Asia and America. You see a way out of this difficult situation in the measures described in the 2020 strategy. I do not wish to question your ambition to lead Europe out of these problems, but I see the greatest obstacle to economic growth in Europe in a problem that you have not mentioned at all. It is the European Union's complicated business environment with its extraordinarily luxuriant bureaucracy which effectively stifles creativity and entrepreneurship, characteristics that are just as common here in Europe as they are in the US, Japan, China and India.",37,1
54,"We need to eliminate all pockets of inefficiency. We will build on recommendations from the Court of Auditors to improve financial management. Honourable Members, the final challenge I want to address today is how we pull our weight on the global stage. When we deal with our everyday problems, we sometimes lose perspective and forget Europe's achievements: a peaceful and successful transition to a European Union that has doubled in size and is negotiating further accessions; a sound currency - the euro - that is a major world currency; and a strong partnership with our neighbourhood that strengthens us all.",2,5
248,"Mr President, I should have liked to have heard Mr Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, also speak in this debate. In my view, the state of the Union should also reflect the institutional reality of the Union. Indeed, since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, we have witnessed a kind of 'presidentialisation' embodied by the President of the European Council in several key areas of European policy. In the management of the euro crisis, the task force set up by the European Council and chaired by Mr Van Rompuy could have been, I believe, the subject of a debate on the state of the Union.",28,2
194,"We Europeans will not be helping if we polarise discussion of such a sensitive issue. We have said - I said it just now very clearly - that the principled position of the Commission and the European Union is to oppose all forms of discrimination. It is totally unacceptable. However, when it comes to responding to questions that are being asked in some of our countries, we must also say that all our citizens have rights and obligations.",12,2
24,Most of the competences for employment policy remain with Member States. We know that. But we will not stand on the sidelines. I want a European Union that helps its people to seize new opportunities and that is social and inclusive.,2,4
18,"We are legislating to outlaw bonuses for quick wins today that become big losses tomorrow. As part of this approach, I am also defending taxes on financial activities and we will come forward with proposals this autumn. The political deal on the financial supervision package just concluded is very good news. The Commission proposals, based on the de Larosi√®re report, will give us an effective European supervision system.",2,4
273,"Madam President, it has been an interesting debate. I should just like to point out, however, that there is a crisis of confidence, and perhaps the President of the Commission should acknowledge this very deeply. There is a crisis of confidence in democracy because the public believes that there has been a failure of elected representatives to regulate financial markets and all markets. I think we have to acknowledge our weakness in this respect.",38,2
191,"We want proposals for growth in Europe. This is what we will work towards. Some of you mentioned a problem which, incidentally, will be discussed this afternoon during a parliamentary sitting: the issue of the Roma. I will not go into detail on this issue now, as it will be discussed this afternoon.",12,99
3,"Our interdependence was highlighted and our solidarity was tested as never before. As I look back at how we have reacted, I believe that we have withstood the test. We have provided many of the answers needed - on financial assistance to Member States facing exceptional circumstances, on economic governance, on financial regulation and on growth and jobs. We have been able to build a base camp from which to modernise our economies.",2,5
151,"Why is the Union not liked by such a large number of the citizens, and why is it not meeting their expectations? We come, here, to an important point. It is very good that you concentrated on economic development, on the need for this development in Europe and on the need for new jobs. I certainly do share the position that one of the greatest problems of the economy in Europe today is unemployment.",8,3
182,"In terms of foreign policy, Europe has become a laughing stock. The example of the Middle East negotiations has been mentioned, where Europe was not even at the table, even though we are the big paymaster throughout the world. Europe barely has any recognition in the world and is, in reality, no great player in terms of foreign policy or global policy. We have managed to bring this European Union to a current state of development where, internally, it is creating a system that its citizens find increasingly oppressive and stringent, that fails to take account of regionalism, cultural diversity and similar factors, and which appears weak to the outside world.",11,1
140,"I will give you another example of what you are not saying. You spoke of the economy, unemployment and growth. You did not say a word about the change that needs to be made to the nature of growth. You did not say that the ecological catastrophe and climate change obliged us to reinterpret our notion of growth.",7,2
4,Europe has shown that it will stand up and be counted. Those who predicted the demise of the European Union were proved wrong. The European institutions and the Member States have demonstrated leadership. My message to each and every European is that you can trust the European Union to do what it takes to secure your future.,2,5
231,"What I would like to know is, what are you going to do, what is the Commission going to do to enforce what is the common feeling of everyone here, namely that citizens' rights are inviolable and must apply to everyone? To this question put to you by all sides of Parliament, you respond: 'We will act in a responsible manner'. However, this response is, unfortunately, based on the idea that platitudes are the strongest weapons of European policy. That simply cannot be the case!",21,2
50,"Pooling money at European level allows Member States to cut their costs, avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment. That is why we should also explore new sources of financing for major European infrastructure projects. For instance, I will propose the establishment of European Union project bonds, together with the European Investment Bank. We will also further develop Public-Private Partnerships.",2,4
177,"The EU has never had so much power, and yet it has never been so unpopular. But not satisfied with the EUR 2.4 billion a year that is now being spent on EU propaganda, you want the overall budget to increase by 6%, and we understand that you personally are to have a full-time TV crew to traipse round with you, new press officers, new webmasters. You are not analysing why this is going wrong, Mr Barroso; you simply do not get it.",10,1
171,"Mr Verhofstadt said that people want more common policies. No! The evidence is clear. Interesting, Mr President!",10,2
79,"We need more European governance. It is for us, Parliament and Commission, to work towards this aim, to convince the Member States to work together and to invest together. This is not about attacking the sovereignty or the prestige of our Member States. On the contrary, it is the only way of seriously and effectively building a future for the 500 million European citizens and for future generations.",4,4
187,"It is also true that some people at national level pursue a purely intergovernmental interpretation of these institutions. We have already clearly defined our vision, and - as I said in my speech, by the way - I am in favour of the Community method and spirit. However, the best way of pursuing the latter is not to engage in endless discussions on the institutions, and still less to engage in institutional guerrilla warfare, which I do not want, and which I will not take part in. The best way is for the Commission to fulfil its initiative-taking role by presenting substantial, bold and high quality proposals, and for you yourselves - as you have done, incidentally - to be able to work with us in this spirit.",12,2
149,"Another man walks by below, and says to him, 'If you saw off that branch, you will fall.' The second man walks on, and the branch breaks. The first man falls out of the tree, gets up, looks at the second man and says, 'Is he a prophet or something?' Ladies and gentlemen, the European Conservatives, even before our political group was formed, were like the second man, who said to the man sitting on the branch of European bureaucracy: 'You are sawing off the branch on which you are sitting.'",8,2
266,"Madam President, President of the Commission, you emphasised very strongly how important it is, with regard to the question of the Roma, to tread carefully and not to talk loudly and openly about what is happening in France. Mr Barroso, I expect you and your Commission to be much clearer on this matter. Of course, it is right to tread carefully, but we should be doing that in our dealings with the people, with the Roma, who have now been expelled from France and sent home. As far as I can see, you have not acted quickly enough and you have not been clear enough in what you have said to the French Government.",35,1
243,We have to have a debate about this.,25,3
288,"We are in the process of establishing this European economic governance. I have said it once and I shall say it again: it is not enough to have a money economy; we need to have a true European economic policy. This is the direction we are going in. I announced it in my speech, and the Commission will fight for these proposals.",42,4
295,"If we want to guarantee the sustainability of our pensions - not just of our pensions but of our children's, too - in the light of Europe's demographic changes and ageing population, then there obviously have to be reforms. It is now up to each government to determine the pace of, consensus on, and scope for root and branch reform. Yet, although we want to win the global competitiveness battle, we cannot do so if working hours are constantly being reduced, if the number of people in active employment is being reduced. We cannot do it, and we must have the courage to say that, if Europe wants to win the competitiveness battle, particularly when faced with certain emerging countries, we must work more and we must work longer.",42,3
204,"Eleven tractors have been stolen from farmers in my canton since 1 January. Do you believe that people are happy? Look what is happening, too, in our various towns. Ladies and gentlemen, we have here a very sensitive subject that we must handle with care for all our fellow citizens, and - I am not starting a national debate, I am starting a European debate - I agree with Mr Barroso on this point.",13,2

144,"Forty per cent of CO2 production in Europe is due to buildings. Use your European resources to create a European energy fund; give European cities the opportunity to renovate buildings throughout Europe by creating a European Keynes fund in Europe, because the national states are not capable of doing it. That is basically my message. There is a great debate in Europe about whether we need public investment.",7,3
170,"Even more revealing is that in your own country of Portugal, over the last six months, a further one in four people have lost total faith in EU institutions. That, Mr Barroso, is hardly an endorsement of success or belief, and yet from most people today, there seems to be such great self-satisfaction. Well, do not be too satisfied, because the people have worked it out for themselves: the real state of the Union is that it is increasingly loathed and despised. And yet some claim that this is because they want more Europe!",10,3
186,"That is what I presented to you today, with specific and ambitious proposals. I do not want to evade any questions, however. It is true that the Union is currently at a turning point. It is true that we have a new treaty.",12,4
233,"Without the appropriate modesty towards citizens, even the loftiest of goals will come crashing down.",21,2
197,"There was discussion of the budget. I heard your speeches. It seems to me that most of you want an ambitious budget for Europe. However, ladies and gentlemen, let us also be extremely clear here: the Commission will bring forward an ambitious budget, but we must not simply hold this debate here, in the European Parliament - we must win over European public opinion.",12,4
134,"I can give you a whole host of examples. Let me come back to Greece. Everyone knows that you were losing control of the situation in Greece; indeed, you knew two or three years before the crisis - you had reports on it in your filing cabinet. There was no official statement.",7,2
298,"How can we guarantee, in such a difficult period, that the investments we make are focused on the future? We in Europe are currently defining the areas in question. I have mentioned the areas in which we are going to make proposals for a more ambitious Europe. In the case of SMEs, we have, of course, mentioned some specific ideas.",42,4
251,"In the United States, if the automotive industry fails in Detroit, people go to Chicago; they will not be able to do this in Europe. If the Commission talks clearly about this now, it will be doing Europe a great service by standing up to the destruction of fundamental principles of the Union that is occurring. If the Commission does not speak up now, it will be doing Europe a great disservice.",29,2
103,"We say that we will support Mr Barroso against Mr ≈†emeta; they will get this request. If you do not do this, we will utilise the instrument of the citizens' initiative. Please believe that!

While European tourists and pensioners travel freely and in huge numbers to the South, especially to the Maghreb, the citizens of those same countries are unable to move around.

The considerable barriers to movement prevent citizens of the South from coming to the countries of the North as tourists, friends or family members.",41,1
285,"Madam President, firstly, I should like to welcome the Belgian Presidency of the Council and to commend it on its speech. I believe that Parliament's aim in holding this debate on the state of the Union was also to launch our programming exercise. That is why we must also focus on legislative work. As you know, in Europe, the Commission has the right of initiative but, afterwards, of course, we need Parliament and the Council to intervene so that we can conclude the legislative process.",42,99

I want to see three million 'green jobs' by 2020 - three million green collar workers that complement our blue and white collar workers. We need sustainable growth, and we also need smart growth. Half of European productivity growth over the last 15 years was driven by information and communication technologies.",2,4
83,"What do we have to do in the months and years to come to consolidate our actions, to strengthen the confidence of our fellow citizens in our joint actions? I will suggest three ways. The first is to strengthen our economy, to reduce inequalities through a series of measures which will encourage returns on investments, the confidence of entrepreneurs and the possibility of developing new creative sources of wealth and jobs. Commissioners, Mr President, we must make the rules 'jump', as you have said, across borders.",4,4
221,"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, I would also like to welcome the speech by the President of the Commission on the state of the Union. This important speech has come at the right time. It allows us to put all the European subjects back on the table following a long institutional transition, and following the economic and financial crisis which has run right across the Union. Mr President, I took careful note of the forward-looking, ambitious approach of the Commission, which aims to respond to current challenges, and also - as we said this morning - to defend the values of the Union.",18,4
153,"This has to be stopped. In your speech, Mr Barroso, I can see you are thinking in the right direction. You spoke about how Europe must speak around the world with one voice. We say this, here, very often, but we can, after all, see easily that different governments in Europe have completely different approaches in fundamental areas of foreign policy.",8,2
291,"I think that will be the best opportunity to enlarge on the very important issues you have raised. On the question of subsidiarity, I am keen to stress that we are in favour of subsidiarity and solidarity in Europe. I did not say that a euro is always better spent at European level than at national level. I did not say that.",42,4
172,"When I barrack people, I get threatened with fines. But never mind. The evidence shows that the more common policies there are, the less people like it. People have recognised the devastation of the common fisheries policy; they have recognised the inequality of the common agricultural policy; the lost business opportunities of a common commercial policy; and, of course, now the big one: the common currency, this ill-conceived political attempt to force people into a monetary union without ever asking any of them whether they wanted to be there.",10,1
39,"In the 20th century we saw, globally, a four-fold growth in population, accompanied by a 40-fold growth in economic output. But in the same period, we also increased our use of fossil fuels 16 times, our fishing catches 35 times and our water use 9 times. Our carbon emissions increased 17 times. That means we have to deliver on our climate and energy package, as a core driver for change.",2,2
292,"What I did say - and what I would say again - is that there are indeed many areas in which there are synergy effects and scale effects. Spending at European level is the only way of ensuring that Europe can act and can derive the maximum benefit for our fellow citizens. We must hold this debate, and we must do so in a serious fashion, because I have seen the majority of MEPs come up with an ambitious idea for the forthcoming budget. We must win this debate in the eyes of the public in our Member States.",42,4
126,"In Copenhagen, we lost our leadership role, and the only way to make a difference in Canc√∫n is to regain that leadership. To regain our leadership, one thing is necessary: to use one voice and promote one vision, and not 27 as we did in Copenhagen. Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I am confused in relation to what is fundamentally - if you will allow me to use this word - the raison d'√™tre of our Union, namely, the protection of civil liberties and human rights, outside the Union, of course, but, more important still, within the European Union as well. I must therefore say, in all solemnity, that what is happening in France is, in my opinion, unacceptable.",6,1
142,"On that, Mr President, you are conspicuously silent. As a result of this, I would like to say that you are the absent president of a Europe which needs a president. That is our problem, and that is the situation of the Union. I would like to conclude by saying one thing to you.",7,1
294,"Some of the policies that you have mentioned here are policies that must be developed at national level. The retirement issue, the social security issue - these are primarily national issues. There are different models. What the Commission says - and we have actually stated this in various documents - is that we obviously have to carry out reforms in this sector.",42,2
252,"Mr President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, if we were in Italy, we would have described your speech as 'Christian Democrat'; in other words, designed to appeal to everyone. Are four million jobs available in Europe? If so, let us give them to our unemployed who, as you know, amount to tens of millions, to create a European labour market. We are emerging from the crisis?",30,2
275,"Madam President, firstly, I must emphasise that many of the aspects that have now been brought into the debate are important ones in this context. We need a new dynamism. We must make a stand for the European Union, for our goals and for our values. The future begins today, not the day after tomorrow.",39,4
297,"If there is no growth, there is no employment. Therefore, budgetary consolidation is a crucial element. At the same time, we need investment in areas that focus, of course, on the future, and we need it at European level and at national level alike. This presents a huge challenge - to us, in the European institutions, but also to those responsible for taking decisions at national level.",42,2
241,"It sounded somehow familiar, but when I think back over the years, I see no proposals. I hope we will have some now. Something else I would have liked to see in a more tangible form is foreign policy. The problem surely is that the Member States will not allow the representatives of the EU any room.",25,2
150,"In your speech, today, I can see a chance that this process of sawing off the branch will end. You have set out many ideas which are most certainly worthy of support, and I think they have been put together in such a way as to please every group in this Parliament. However, we have to agree with Mr Schulz that it was a forward-looking plan, but that we did not hear - and I am not pleased with you about this - an analysis of the current situation in the Union. Why is the Union performing in the way that it is?",8,3
235,"The European Union has been delegated by its Member States with key functions that need to be achieved, such as completing the internal market and furthering international free trade. Those should be priorities, and that is why we support the principles of President Barroso's centre-piece initiative - Europe 2020 - and the single market relaunch, which members of my own group have been so involved with.",22,4
15,"We will match monetary union with true economic union. If implemented as we propose, these reforms will also guarantee the long-term stability of the euro. It is key to our economic success. For the economy to grow, we also need a strong and sound financial sector - a sector that serves the real economy and that prides itself on proper regulation and proper supervision.",2,4
45,"Racism and xenophobia have no place in Europe. On such sensitive issues, and when a problem arises, we must all act with responsibility. I make a strong appeal not to re-awaken the ghosts of Europe's past. An area of freedom, liberty and security will create a place where Europeans can prosper.",2,3
110,"Either this Europe is a Europe of intergovernmentalism, or it is a Europe of the Community method. The Europe of the Community method is the Europe of the Commission and of the European Parliament, working together. I found your stocktake incomplete. I found most of your perspectives and the announcements to be good and proper.",5,3
175,"Well we do not. Who is in charge of this EU? Is it you, Mr Barroso? Is it my old friend, Herman Van Rompuy?",10,2
276,"Therefore, a good analysis, coupled with the correct consequences for the future, is necessary. We are currently facing problems. There is a fight taking place between the future and a common Europe, on the one hand, and the strengthening of nationalism, on the other. We need to decide that, as in the past, we once again wish to utilise this crisis to take the next step towards integration.",39,2
190,We are in favour of consolidating financial regulation. We have clearly declared that we will not abdicate the Commission's right of initiative. We also want the banks and the financial institutions to contribute to solving the problem that they helped to create. That is why we are in favour of taxing financial activity.,12,4
22,"We must frontload and accelerate the most growth-promoting reforms of our agenda. This could raise growth levels by over a third by 2020. This means concentrating on three priorities: getting more people into jobs, boosting our companies' competitiveness and deepening the single market. Let me start with people and jobs.",2,4
49,"It is for the people that you represent - for the unemployed workers being retrained by the Social Fund, for the students that participate in the Erasmus programme, and for the regions that benefit from the Cohesion Fund. Energy interconnections, research, and development aid are obvious examples where a euro spent at European level gets you more than a euro spent at national level. As you know, some Member States are seeing this logic even in areas of core national competence, like defence. They recognise that huge savings could be made if they pooled some of their means and activities.",2,4
299,"I would also urge you to consider the document accompanying my speech, in particular, with regard to the Single Market Act, the legislation that we are going to propose with regard to electronic signatures, the numerous simplification measures, and the removal of certain obstacles which currently make the lives of our businesses, particularly our small and medium-sized enterprises, very difficult. The truth is that, for the vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises, there is no integrated market as yet. They mainly operate in their national markets, but there are no real cross-border opportunities they can exploit as yet. To conclude, I must tell you that we believe, like those of you who raised the point, that there is a confidence issue.",42,2
11,"Earlier this year, we acted decisively when euro area members and the euro itself needed our help. We have learned hard lessons. Now we are making important progress on economic governance. The Commission put its ideas on the table in May and in June.",2,4
80,"I therefore ask the Commission - I ask you, Mr Barroso, but every other Commissioner too - to take more initiatives to propose the measures and reforms that we need in Europe so that things function better, and to explain these projects to our fellow citizens. Along with my group, I would like our Parliament to support these efforts by using its new prerogatives as a colegislator with the Council. This is not solely a question of power, it is a question of comprehension, and it is a question that we must discuss in order to make Europe progress. President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, while we must be ambitious, we must also look back at the path that has been travelled.",4,3
258,Most Member States are facing deficit- and debt-related problems. Legislative proposals have been drawn up at European level. These proposals need to be finalised and implemented. Only a common financial policy and European economic governance can resolve the current situation.,32,2
73,"It is indeed a transformational, ambitious and challenging agenda. For Europe to succeed, the Commission needs your support for a stronger, fairer Europe for the benefit of our citizens.",2,4
156,"We cannot accept situations in which one or other of the governments in Europe tries, for domestic purposes, to ignite what has, in Europe, been the powder keg of nationalism and chauvinism. There can be no consent to this, but this is what is happening in many European countries. This year, we have already had examples of countries bordering Poland where attempts have been made to make political capital out of matters related to minorities. One of the European Union's greatest achievements is the fact that Europe has been an area of democracy and tolerance where war has been absent for 60 years.",8,3
225,"Mr President, although the speeches by the group leaders this morning have differed greatly in tone, one thing is clear, and that is that many of the policy actions announced by the European Commission can count on broad support in this House, as all of us together advocate the Community method. Many more discussions will have to be held on the substance. This morning, I should like to call for special attention to youth, to our children. After all, they must be well equipped to generate prosperity for us in the future, so that good public services will remain and the growing group of older people can continue to receive a pension.",19,4
290,"Ultimately, we need to have the clear support of this Parliament and also the support, sometimes the unanimous support, of our Member States. The Commission is shouldering its responsibilities, and I now call on the other institutions to follow suit. On the Roma issue, there will be a special debate on this this afternoon. The Vice-President and Commissioner for Justice and Fundamental Rights, Mrs Reding, and the Commissioner for Social Affairs, Mr Andor, will be present.",42,3
63,"In Europe, we condemn such acts, which have no justification under any moral or religious code. Our values also mean that we must come to the aid of those facing a crisis situation, anywhere around the world. Our humanitarian aid to Pakistan is the latest example of Europe's solidarity in action. It is a striking example of the need to present the different contributions of the Commission and the Member States as a truly European aid package.",2,5
64,The Member States have the helicopters and the civil protection teams. We now need to pool them to create a real European crisis response capacity. This is what the Commission will propose in October. I urge the Member States to show they are serious about the Union punching its weight in this area.,2,4
118,"We have already produced legislation on capital requirements and on bonuses. We have the stress test, and last week we also reached an agreement on financial supervision, which is a good agreement, not least because leadership by the President of the European Central Bank guarantees a European approach to supervision. However, that does not mean that we are already there. Far from it, I should say.",6,2
240,"Mr President, while I was listening to Mr Barroso's speech, it was a speech about a work programme. I thought that perhaps it was a problem for the EU that no analysis of the state of the EU could be made within the EU. There were a lot of excellent objectives mentioned in the speech but nothing very concrete. I am thinking, for example, of the promise that Mr Barroso made that the EU would stand by small and medium¬≠sized enterprises.",25,2
168,"Mr President, this grand occasion, Mr Barroso's State of the Union speech, does not quite put him on a par with President Obama. There is one fundamental difference, Mr Barroso: President Obama is elected, and you are not. Forty-eight million people watched his address, and here in the European Parliament we even have to beg MEPs to turn up to listen to you. You completely ignored the state of the Union.",10,1
269,"I have a message for President Barroso. The Dakota Indian tribe have a saying: 'If you are sitting on a dead horse, dismount.' Your recommended 20-20-20 policy (the 20-20-20 targets) is just such a dead horse. Putting this saying into a European Union context, our behaviour is the opposite to that of these Indians.",36,1
152,"However, let us be honest. One cannot have the right kind of concern about the fate of the unemployed and about the disappearance of jobs in Europe, on the one hand, while, on the other, proposing economic solutions which quite naturally lead to the export of jobs from Europe to other continents. These two things cannot be separated. We cannot say we want to increase the level of employment in Europe, on the one hand, while, on the other, imposing new burdens and a new sentence of death by bureaucracy on European firms and the European economy.",8,1
