{"Number":290,"Text":"Ultimately, we need to have the clear support of this Parliament and also the support, sometimes the unanimous support, of our Member States. The Commission is shouldering its responsibilities, and I now call on the other institutions to follow suit. On the Roma issue, there will be a special debate on this this afternoon. The Vice-President and Commissioner for Justice and Fundamental Rights, Mrs Reding, and the Commissioner for Social Affairs, Mr Andor, will be present.","Speech":42,"Coding":3,"LSD":{"positive":6,"negative":1,"positive_words":["responsibilities","rights","special","support","support","support"],"positive_seeds":["responsib*","rights","special","support*","support*","support*"],"negative_words":["vice"],"negative_seeds":["vice"]}}
{"Number":63,"Text":"In Europe, we condemn such acts, which have no justification under any moral or religious code. Our values also mean that we must come to the aid of those facing a crisis situation, anywhere around the world. Our humanitarian aid to Pakistan is the latest example of Europe's solidarity in action. It is a striking example of the need to present the different contributions of the Commission and the Member States as a truly European aid package.","Speech":2,"Coding":5,"LSD":{"positive":7,"negative":2,"positive_words":["aid","aid","aid","contributions","humanitarian","justification","moral"],"positive_seeds":["aid","aid","aid","contribution*","humanitarian*","justif*","moral"],"negative_words":["condemn","crisis"],"negative_seeds":["condemn*","crisi*"]}}
{"Number":64,"Text":"The Member States have the helicopters and the civil protection teams. We now need to pool them to create a real European crisis response capacity.

{"Number":118,"Text":"We have already produced legislation on capital requirements and on bonuses. We have the stress test, and last week we also reached an agreement on financial supervision, which is a good agreement, not least because leadership by the President of the European Central Bank guarantees a European approach to supervision. However, that does not mean that we are already there.

{"Number":240,"Text":"Mr President, while I was listening to Mr Barroso's speech, it was a speech about a work programme. I thought that perhaps it was a problem for the EU that no analysis of the state of the EU could be made within the EU. There were a lot of excellent objectives mentioned in the speech but nothing very concrete. I am thinking, for example, of the promise that Mr Barroso made that the EU would stand by small and medium¬≠sized enterprises.","Speech":25,"Coding":2,"LSD":{"positive":1,"negative":1,"positive_words":["excellent"],"positive_seeds":["excel*"],"negative_words":["problem"],"negative_seeds":["problem"]}}
{"Number":168,"Text":"Mr President, this grand occasion, Mr Barroso's State of the Union speech, does not quite put him on a par with President Obama. There is one fundamental difference, Mr Barroso: President Obama is elected, and you are not. Forty-eight million people watched his address, and here in the European Parliament we even have to beg MEPs to turn up to listen to you. You completely ignored the state of the Union.","Speech":10,"Coding":1,"LSD":{"positive":1,"negative":1,"positive_words":["grand"],"positive_seeds":["grand"],"negative_words":["ignored"],"negative_seeds":["ignor*"]}}

Your recommended 20-20-20 policy (the 20-20-20 targets) is just such a dead horse.

{"Number":152,"Text":"However, let us be honest. One cannot have the right kind of concern about the fate of the unemployed and about the disappearance of jobs in Europe, on the one hand, while, on the other, proposing economic solutions which quite naturally lead to the export of jobs from Europe to other continents. These two things cannot be separated. We cannot say we want to increase the level of employment in Europe, on the one hand, while, on the other, imposing new burdens and a new sentence of death by bureaucracy on European firms and the European economy.","Speech":8,"Coding":1,"LSD":{"positive":2,"negative":3,"positive_words":["honest","right"],"positive_seeds":["honest*","right"],"negative_words":["burdens","concern","death"],"negative_seeds":["burden*","concern","death*"]}}
