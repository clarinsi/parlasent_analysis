{"Number":167,"Text":"I believe that the European Union has a good tradition. However, anyone who wants to combat social anxieties at the expense of a social minority, and indeed using unfair means, is abusing his political powers. I want to make this very clear: the abuse of social anxieties is simply unacceptable for a Community that always makes a point of standing up for universal human rights and moral values. These moral values and human rights apply to French, Polish, English, Spanish or German people in the European Union, just as they do for all Sinti and Roma who live in Europe.","Speech":9,"Coding":3,"LSD":{"positive":6,"negative":7,"positive_words":["good","moral","moral","polish","rights","rights"],"positive_seeds":["good","moral","moral","polish*","rights","rights"],"negative_words":["abusing","abuse","anxieties","anxieties","combat","unacceptable","unfair"],"negative_seeds":["abus*","abus*","anxi*","anxi*","combat","unacceptab*","unfair*"]}}

Your speech emphasised the social market economy and social cohesion, but your programme emphasises competition on the market and fiscal consolidation, which precludes a social market agenda. I want to see you using Articles 3, 9, 14 and Protocol 26 to their fullest legal and policy extent in order to develop a new social pact for Europe.

Now they are asking themselves who is responsible for this, particularly when, despite a better economic outlook, they are being hit by the Member States' austerity measures. These austerity measures will result in rising prices for public services, cuts in social benefits, cuts in education services, pay cuts, an extended working life in the face of uncertain pensions and often precarious employment situations.
