{"Number":59,"Text":"The more we are able to establish a common agenda, with a clearly defined European interest, the more we will achieve. For example, I see huge potential in developing a transatlantic agenda for growth and jobs. Where we are already punching our weight is the G20, the forum where the key economic global players address common challenges. When President Van Rompuy and I go to Seoul in November, representing the European Union, we want to see concrete results - further progress in global economic coordination, more stable and responsible financial markets and agreement on reform of international financial institutions, more effective global financial safety nets, and more progress on a G20 development agenda.","Speech":2,"Coding":5,"LSD":{"positive":9,"negative":2,"positive_words":["achieve","agreement","coordination","effective","progress","progress","responsible","safety","stable"],"positive_seeds":["achiev*","agree*","coordination","effectiv*","progress","progress","responsib*","safety*","stable"],"negative_words":["challenges","punching"],"negative_seeds":["challeng*","punching"]}}

Essentially, I see five major challenges for the Union over the next year: dealing with the economic crisis and governance; restoring growth for jobs by accelerating the Europe 2020 reform agenda; building an area of freedom, justice and security; launching negotiations for a modern EU budget; and pulling our weight on the global stage.

However, anyone who wants to combat social anxieties at the expense of a social minority, and indeed using unfair means, is abusing his political powers. I want to make this very clear: the abuse of social anxieties is simply unacceptable for a Community that always makes a point of standing up for universal human rights and moral values.
