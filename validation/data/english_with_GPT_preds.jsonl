{"text":"If there is no growth, there is no employment. Therefore, budgetary consolidation is a crucial element. At the same time, we need investment in areas that focus, of course, on the future, and we need it at European level and at national level alike. This presents a huge challenge - to us, in the European institutions, but also to those responsible for taking decisions at national level.","label":2,"GPT_pred":3.5,"GPT_cat_pred":3}

The truth is that, for the vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises, there is no integrated market as yet. They mainly operate in their national markets, but there are no real cross-border opportunities they can exploit as yet. To conclude, I must tell you that we believe, like those of you who raised the point, that there is a confidence issue.","label":2,"GPT_pred":2.5,"GPT_cat_pred":1}
